		<content><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time Finance</a> are delighted to announce that they have supported Lancashire-based business, SEP Rail Services, expand their operations and secure new contracts. The new fleet of leased vehicles supplied by Time Finance will play an instrumental role in helping drive their business forward.</p>

<p>The firm which measures, models, and engineers the nation’s railways has built a strong reputation for the high quality, reliability, and flexibility of its services. SEP Rail Services proudly support their clients throughout the lifetime of their projects, with services including railway track and structure monitoring, site engineering, and ground investigation.</p>

<p>With much of their time spent on the road, travelling between sites to carry out essential surveying services, investing in a new fleet of vehicles was a vital part of their growth journey. Having already built a long-standing relationship with Time Finance through the wider SEP group, the business could depend on a quick and reliable supply of new vehicles. The fleet ranging from commercial vans to executive vehicles, will support employees across the entirety of the business.</p>

<p>Rikki Morrow, director at SEP Rail Services, commented: “As a business, we are passionate about building long-standing and strategic relationships that we can always rely on. We are delighted that we have been able to depend on Time Finance for a high level of service and quick turnaround with every order we make. The team have really taken the time to understand how our business operates and what our needs are. This makes all the difference in helping us to achieve our growth plans and make key investments with confidence. These fantastic new vehicles are a massive asset to the business and help our teams get out onto the road and support our expanding client base.”</p>

<p>Just 2.5 years after the business was set up, SEP Rail Services are now recognized as the fastest growing rail surveying company in the UK. Having started with just a handful of staff, the business has now grown to a workforce with over 40 full-time employees and report an annual turnover of approximately £3m.</p>

<p>Andrew Gosling, Head of <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/vehicle-finance">Vehicles</a> at Time Finance, added: “We are thrilled to continue supporting Rikki and the business as they continue to scale up and take on new contracts. In the short time the business has been trading, theirs is a fantastic success story and one we are proud to be a part of. We wish the best of luck to Rikki and his team and look forward to continuing to support the business for many more years to come.”</p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<p>Limchester Properties are set to invest in a new buy-to-let property in the Bristol area thanks to the re-mortgaging of an existing property portfolio.</p>

<p>Clive Mcnamara, director at Limchester Properties, reached out to loan broker, Just Contact, to identify a viable lending solution that would allow him to raise the £750,000 capital needed to invest in a new business venture.</p>

<p>Specialist lending packager, <a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time Finance</a>, approached their panel of lenders on the broker’s and client’s behalf. Their long-standing relationships with key lending institutions meant they could bring this business plan to life by swiftly sourcing the best deal and at a competitive rate.</p>

<p>Despite tight time constraints and complicated nature of the deal, the £2.35m contract was completed with ease and the client was able to secure the new property whilst remaining on an interest-only mortgage.</p>

<p>Alun Winter, Head of <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/loans" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Loans</a> at Time Finance, said: “This deal was particularly unusual and quirky as 8 of the 19 flats in the existing property portfolio measured under the square footage usually accepted by lenders on our panel. We recognised Clive’s extensive expertise in this field and impressive property portfolio and because of this got the deal agreed with one of our lenders. The ease of completion is testament to the long-standing relationships and strong levels of communications our processing teams develop with all parties involved. Overall, we’re delighted to have been able to support Clive as he continues to invest in and grow his property portfolio.”</p>

<p>Clive Mcnamara, Director at Limchester Properties, said: “I am very pleased to have completed this buy to let purchase with Time Finance and Just Contact, who helped me get this deal across the line. I can now look forward to investing in new premises and expanding my property portfolio further.”</p>

<p>Iain McGregor, Broker at Just Contact, added: “It’s always a pleasure to work with the team at Intelligent Loans and together, our client-driven approach meant that we were able to help this already successful business grow. It was a fantastic outcome for Clive who was delighted at how hassle-free the process had been.”</p>]]></content>

		<title><![CDATA[Cheese Manufacturer Secures Large Contract With Asset Finance Facility]]></title>
		<slug><![CDATA[cheese-manufacturer-asset-finance]]></slug>
		<published><![CDATA[2020-08-12 15:32:38]]></published>
		<updated><![CDATA[2020-08-12 15:32:38]]></updated>
		<content><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time Finance</a> has supported a Welsh-based cheese manufacturer invest in a vital piece of specialist equipment through the provision of a £77k asset finance facility and secure a major supermarket contract.</p>

<p>The family-owned business Blaenafon of Cheddar was set up by husband and wife team, Gerry Woodhouse and Susan Fiander-Woodhouse, who are passionate about producing cheese with a difference. Their award-winning collection of distinctively unique flavoured cheddars include Prosecco and Strawberry, Taffy Apple, and Aubergine Firecracker.</p>

<p>The business has grown awareness of its cheeses through its presence at major events and festivals, and in doing so achieved coverage across a variety of TV &amp; Media worldwide. As Blaenafon of Cheddar secured larger contracts and scaled up their business, they found they needed to invest in new machinery to keep up with the growing demand. Where previously the business had waxed all cheeses by hand, the financing of a vital piece of equipment which automatically wax-coats the cheese was essential if they were to achieve their growth aspirations. The equipment supplied by Vantage House will allow for a faster and more efficient production process.</p>

<p>Susan Fiander-Woodhouse, Director at Blaenafon of Cheddar, commented: “The support from Time Finance has been invaluable. They really took the time to understand our business and what was needed to scale up our operations. Gaining access to the funding and then the equipment was really smooth and easy. It has meant that we can protect our cashflow, managing the cost of this vital equipment and spreading the cost over an agreed period of time. The fast turnaround has meant that we could quickly adapt our existing production process and fulfil our new contract on time!”</p>

<p>Carol Roberts, Head of<a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/asset-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&nbsp;Asset</a> at Time Finance, added: “It’s a pleasure to support Blaenafon of Cheddar, which is a fantastic success story of a family-run business growing and adapting their operations to manufacture more delicious products to meet growing demand. <a href="https://timefinance.com/time-blog/how-does-asset-finance-work">Asset finance can take the stress out of upscaling a business</a> and this equipment will help them fulfil their new contracts, improve their production processes and enable them to grow its product range. We wish them the best of luck on their journey to delivering its products to the corners of the UK from its Welsh base.”</p>

<p>As Susan concludes: “Our passion is to offer customers unique and high-quality cheeses and securing this equipment means we can accelerate our production, increase the amount of cheeses we supply and continue to focus on developing new varieties of cheese for our customers in the future.”</p>

		<content><![CDATA[<p>A study by Nationwide Building Society revealed that two-thirds of people are guilty of skipping the small print. Perhaps unsurprising given how time-consuming it can be to read the full terms and conditions of contracts. However, the consequences of failing to do so can be quite severe. So why is it so important to read the small print?</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h4>The small print is contractual</h4>

<p>Every word of a contract is part of the legal agreement – and this includes the small print found in the terms and conditions. Unless you have thoroughly read the entire contract, you won’t actually know the intricacies of what you’re paying for. More often than not, the important details of the agreement are hidden away in the terms and conditions. By signing a contract without having properly read it, how can you be sure what you’re really agreeing to?</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h4>There may be hidden charges</h4>

<p>When you’re accepting the terms of service, you could be signing up for additional charges without even realising it. Carefully check every page to make sure you’re not agreeing to pay for additional services or fees that will leave you out of pocket.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h4>There may be additional benefits</h4>

<p>You may be missing key benefits, which you would have not otherwise known if you fail to read the small print. Many services have terms and conditions that allow for a cooling-off period – usually a minimum of 14 days – where you can cancel or amend the terms, so make a note of when this is.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h4>Repayment terms may be longer than expected</h4>

<p>If you see a deal that looks too good to be true – it probably is. Similarly, if you see a deal with monthly repayments that look suspiciously low, it’s important to check the terms. Typically, the longer the repayment period, the lower the monthly costs, so double-check how long it runs for before you’re locked into a contract that extends past the expected term.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h4>Not all contracts are the same</h4>

<p>You’ve signed up for a similar contract before, so this one will be exactly the same – right? It’s an easy mistake to make, but ultimately the terms and conditions will vary between different businesses and services, so don’t assume it will be the same this time around. It may contain unexpected extras, duplications or omissions that you didn’t previously encounter, so make sure to stay vigilant.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>Here at <a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time Finance</a> we know that the small print is as crucial as any other wording within the contract – and that’s why we pride ourselves on our friendly, straight-talking account managers who keep the application and decision process as simple and jargon-free as possible. We’ll talk you through all of the terms and conditions, no matter if you’re looking for finance for a new car, business equipment or a cash flow injection to help your business grow. Get in touch with our team today to find out how we can help.</p>]]></content>

More often than not, the important details of the agreement are hidden away in the terms and conditions. By signing a contract without having properly read it, how can you be sure what you’re really agreeing to?</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h4>There may be hidden charges</h4>

<p>When you’re accepting the terms of service, you could be signing up for additional charges without even realising it. Carefully check every page to make sure you’re not agreeing to pay for additional services or fees that will leave you out of pocket.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h4>There may be additional benefits</h4>

<p>You may be missing key benefits, which you would have not otherwise known if you fail to read the small print. Many services have terms and conditions that allow for a cooling-off period – usually a minimum of 14 days – where you can cancel or amend the terms, so make a note of when this is.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h4>Repayment terms may be longer than expected</h4>

<p>If you see a deal that looks too good to be true – it probably is. Similarly, if you see a deal with monthly repayments that look suspiciously low, it’s important to check the terms. Typically, the longer the repayment period, the lower the monthly costs, so double-check how long it runs for before you’re locked into a contract that extends past the expected term.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h4>Not all contracts are the same</h4>

<p>You’ve signed up for a similar contract before, so this one will be exactly the same – right? It’s an easy mistake to make, but ultimately the terms and conditions will vary between different businesses and services, so don’t assume it will be the same this time around. It may contain unexpected extras, duplications or omissions that you didn’t previously encounter, so make sure to stay vigilant.</p>

		<content><![CDATA[<p>A study by Nationwide Building Society revealed that two-thirds of people are guilty of skipping the small print. Perhaps unsurprising given how time-consuming it can be to read the full terms and conditions of contracts. However, the consequences of failing to do so can be quite severe. So why is it so important to read the small print?</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h4>The small print is contractual</h4>

<p>Every word of a contract is part of the legal agreement – and this includes the small print found in the terms and conditions. Unless you have thoroughly read the entire contract, you won’t actually know the intricacies of what you’re paying for. More often than not, the important details of the agreement are hidden away in the terms and conditions. By signing a contract without having properly read it, how can you be sure what you’re really agreeing to?</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h4>There may be hidden charges</h4>

<p>When you’re accepting the terms of service, you could be signing up for additional charges without even realising it. Carefully check every page to make sure you’re not agreeing to pay for additional services or fees that will leave you out of pocket.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h4>There may be additional benefits</h4>

<p>You may be missing key benefits, which you would have not otherwise known if you fail to read the small print. Many services have terms and conditions that allow for a cooling-off period – usually a minimum of 14 days – where you can cancel or amend the terms, so make a note of when this is.</p>

		<published><![CDATA[2020-08-12 15:32:38]]></published>
		<updated><![CDATA[2020-08-12 15:32:38]]></updated>
		<content><![CDATA[<p>Asset Finance, Invoice Finance, Loans, Vehicle Finance... the list for business finance goes on and on. It can often seem like a minefield trying to navigate your way through the various financial options available on the market. So, how do you know what funding stream is right for your business? We’ll explore each one in more detail, to arm you with the knowledge you need to make the right decision to achieve future growth and sustainability.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h4>Asset Finance</h4>

<p><a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/asset-finance">Asset Finance provides you with access to the equipment your business needs</a> by allowing you to borrow a sum of money to cover the cost. The funder purchases the equipment on the company’s behalf, then in return <a href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/equipment-leasing">they lease the equipment to the customer for fixed, monthly rental payments</a>. This type of finance allows you to invest in vital areas of your business for a manageable annual sum and is often a more tax efficient, flexible and affordable solution than purchasing.</p>

<p>There are two types of Asset Finance – soft asset and hard asset.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Soft assets – These include office equipment, software, catering equipment and typically have a low resale value.</li>
	<li>Hard assets – These include vehicles, machinery, manufacturing equipment. All of which can be new and used, and tend to have a higher resale value than soft assets.</li>
</ul>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h4>Invoice Finance</h4>

<p><a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance">Invoice Finance is an excellent way of improving cashflow</a>, to ensure you pay employees and suppliers on time. Typically, this type of business finance is taken by business owners who face extended payment terms from their customers and need access to additional working capital. By unlocking up to 90% of unpaid invoices, businesses can receive the cash injection they need, <a href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/debt-factoring">rather than waiting for customers to settle their debts in full</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://timefinance.com/time-blog/invoice-finance-solutions-the-ultimate-guide-to-factoring-vs-discounting">There are two types of Invoice Finance – Factoring and Invoice Discounting</a>:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.timefinance.com/finance-products/invoice-factoring"><strong>Invoice Factoring</strong></a><strong>:</strong> This is a way of unlocking cash flow by raising up to 90% of the gross value of unpaid invoices. <a href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/invoice-factoring">In addition to generating additional working capital, using a factoring service can reduce business expenditure by outsourcing credit control</a>. Here, the Invoice Finance company will support your business with credit control services, contacting debtors on your behalf and collecting payments.</li>
	<li><a href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/invoice-discounting"><strong>Invoice Discounting</strong></a><strong>:</strong> This facility provides a similar level of funding but allows you to maintain the customer relationship and credit control, rather than outsourcing that responsibility to the Invoice Finance provider.</li>
</ul>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h4>Business Loans</h4>

<p>The traditional one of the pack – it’s as simple as it sounds. <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/loans" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Business loans</a> are a method of borrowing, specifically for commercial entities. Business loans – which can be used for any purpose relating to your business, including expanding operations, buying stock and taking on new employees – are split into two categories: secured and unsecured.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Secured:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/secured-business-loans">this type of loan requires you to pledge an asset</a> (e.g. a property) as collateral for the loan, which then becomes a secured debt owed to the creditor.</li>
	<li><strong>Unsecured:</strong> a loan that allows you to borrow money without having to offer up any assets as collateral.</li>
</ul>

<p>The decision to offer a business any type of loan is based on the business’ ability to pay back the money borrowed. As such, the funder will carry out in-depth credit and business checks to assess your ability to repay.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h4>Vehicle Finance</h4>

<p><a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/vehicle-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vehicle Finance</a> is an excellent alternative to buying a vehicle outright. Because there is no need to pay one lump sum, it allows you to hold on to your financial savings and help you purchase or lease a vehicle in a manageable way. You will have an agreement for how much you pay every month, meaning you can budget for future expenses much easier. Another benefit for this source of finance is that you can often afford a higher quality and more expensive car because you can split your payments over an extended period of time.</p>

		<content><![CDATA[<p>Asset Finance, Invoice Finance, Loans, Vehicle Finance... the list for business finance goes on and on. It can often seem like a minefield trying to navigate your way through the various financial options available on the market. So, how do you know what funding stream is right for your business? We’ll explore each one in more detail, to arm you with the knowledge you need to make the right decision to achieve future growth and sustainability.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h4>Asset Finance</h4>

<p><a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/asset-finance">Asset Finance provides you with access to the equipment your business needs</a> by allowing you to borrow a sum of money to cover the cost. The funder purchases the equipment on the company’s behalf, then in return <a href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/equipment-leasing">they lease the equipment to the customer for fixed, monthly rental payments</a>. This type of finance allows you to invest in vital areas of your business for a manageable annual sum and is often a more tax efficient, flexible and affordable solution than purchasing.</p>

<p>There are two types of Asset Finance – soft asset and hard asset.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Soft assets – These include office equipment, software, catering equipment and typically have a low resale value.</li>
	<li>Hard assets – These include vehicles, machinery, manufacturing equipment. All of which can be new and used, and tend to have a higher resale value than soft assets.</li>
</ul>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h4>Invoice Finance</h4>

<p><a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance">Invoice Finance is an excellent way of improving cashflow</a>, to ensure you pay employees and suppliers on time. Typically, this type of business finance is taken by business owners who face extended payment terms from their customers and need access to additional working capital. By unlocking up to 90% of unpaid invoices, businesses can receive the cash injection they need, <a href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/debt-factoring">rather than waiting for customers to settle their debts in full</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://timefinance.com/time-blog/invoice-finance-solutions-the-ultimate-guide-to-factoring-vs-discounting">There are two types of Invoice Finance – Factoring and Invoice Discounting</a>:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.timefinance.com/finance-products/invoice-factoring"><strong>Invoice Factoring</strong></a><strong>:</strong> This is a way of unlocking cash flow by raising up to 90% of the gross value of unpaid invoices. <a href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/invoice-factoring">In addition to generating additional working capital, using a factoring service can reduce business expenditure by outsourcing credit control</a>. Here, the Invoice Finance company will support your business with credit control services, contacting debtors on your behalf and collecting payments.</li>
	<li><a href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/invoice-discounting"><strong>Invoice Discounting</strong></a><strong>:</strong> This facility provides a similar level of funding but allows you to maintain the customer relationship and credit control, rather than outsourcing that responsibility to the Invoice Finance provider.</li>
</ul>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h4>Business Loans</h4>

<p>The traditional one of the pack – it’s as simple as it sounds. <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/loans" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Business loans</a> are a method of borrowing, specifically for commercial entities. Business loans – which can be used for any purpose relating to your business, including expanding operations, buying stock and taking on new employees – are split into two categories: secured and unsecured.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Secured:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/secured-business-loans">this type of loan requires you to pledge an asset</a> (e.g. a property) as collateral for the loan, which then becomes a secured debt owed to the creditor.</li>
	<li><strong>Unsecured:</strong> a loan that allows you to borrow money without having to offer up any assets as collateral.</li>
</ul>

<p>The decision to offer a business any type of loan is based on the business’ ability to pay back the money borrowed. As such, the funder will carry out in-depth credit and business checks to assess your ability to repay.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h4>Vehicle Finance</h4>

<p><a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/vehicle-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vehicle Finance</a> is an excellent alternative to buying a vehicle outright. Because there is no need to pay one lump sum, it allows you to hold on to your financial savings and help you purchase or lease a vehicle in a manageable way. You will have an agreement for how much you pay every month, meaning you can budget for future expenses much easier. Another benefit for this source of finance is that you can often afford a higher quality and more expensive car because you can split your payments over an extended period of time.</p>

		<slug><![CDATA[the-importance-of-cashflow]]></slug>
		<published><![CDATA[2020-08-12 15:32:38]]></published>
		<updated><![CDATA[2020-08-12 15:32:38]]></updated>
		<content><![CDATA[<p>Cashflow is a major aspect of running a business. It’s the process of ensuring that cash coming in to the business is greater than the outgoing expenditure. Not having a steady flow of cash can result in late payments to suppliers, HMRC and even staff – in fact, the failure of up to 90 per cent of SMEs is due to poor cash flow management. The Office for National Statistics has shown that around half of the UK’s small businesses <a href="https://timefinance.com/time-blog/late-invoice-payments-what-to-do">regularly receive late payments</a>.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h4>Profitability doesn’t mean a healthy cashflow</h4>

<p><a href="https://timefinance.com/time-blog/cash-flow-issues-in-business">Cashflow issues can be particularly challenging</a> when a business is just starting up, as there is usually a period where overheads and expenses are having to be paid before sales and the subsequent payments from customers are received. A business needs to be able to cover rent, the cost of stock, employees and operating expenses, which can be hard if there’s no cash. Many businesses find that they aren’t operating as successfully or aren’t as profitable as they could be, simply because they are struggling to manage their cash.</p>

<p>However, it’s not an issue that exclusively impacts fledgeling businesses. In most industries, payment terms are on 30, 60 or even 90 days, with no guarantee that these will be paid on time – so even if an established business is making a profit, the cash could still be tied up in unpaid invoices.</p>

<p>But good cashflow requires planning. Putting together a cashflow forecast to estimate the ingoings and outgoings of the business will give a more comprehensive overview of what to expect financially, and also highlight when additional funding may be necessary.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h4>Choosing the best option</h4>

<p>There has never been a wider range of funding packages available to small businesses but choosing the right option can be difficult. It would make sense to fund the purchase of a building through a commercial mortgage and a vehicle through an HP or leasing deal, but what about day-to-day working capital?</p>

<p><a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Invoice Finance&nbsp;</a>has seen a major increase in popularity as a source of working capital finance in recent years, so much so that it is now more widely used than traditional bank overdrafts. Invoice Finance allows businesses to release up to 90 per cent of the value of its unpaid invoices within 24 hours of the invoice being raised. Upon payment by the customer, the remaining balance is paid to the business, minus the agreed fee. Having access to funds as soon as an order is completed rather than having to wait to be paid 30, 60 or 90 days later allows businesses to accurately plan their cashflow as it puts the control back in the hands of the business owner. Unlike a bank overdraft, the facility will also increase in line with sales and is not repayable on demand – business owners don’t even need to provide their houses as security!</p>

<p>So if you’re looking to strengthen your cashflow, Invoice Finance could be a way of helping you to maximise your business opportunities and let you focus on more important things, like growing your business. Our dedicated team of Invoice Finance specialists help small businesses across the UK access cash when they need it most.</p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<p>As the covid-19 pandemic presents unprecedented challenges, government guidelines to stay indoors and socially distance have dramatically changed the business landscape as we know it. With many businesses forced to close their doors to the public or downsize current operations, businesses of all sizes are being forced to think of new ways of working. In this fast-changing marketplace, now more than ever, innovation and adaption are key for SMEs.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>Small business owners are familiar with the preparations required to manage common business challenges, whether that be a seasonal shift in sales or unexpected employee absences. With the coronavirus crisis unlike anything ever experienced before, in the face of uncertainty many business owners are having to think on their feet. We are already seeing a great number of businesses providing inspiration and seizing the opportunity to evolve.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>When remote working was enforced, we saw a surge in the investment in technology and online presence. In a growing digital world, businesses can continue to offer help and guidance, promote products and services, and simply stay in touch with customers. From using video technology providing virtual consultations or delivering at-home tutorials, businesses have found new ways to communicate with their audiences in the comfort of their own home. It is key to remember that as social beings, our customers value connectivity more so now than ever.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>In a bid for survival, many business owners have no choice but to change their business offering and as a result are discovering new ways of working and generating revenue. Pivoting through adversity requires innovation and adaptation to a new marketplace. We see restaurants and bars that would usually seat and entertain guests now delivering recipe kits and meals directly to their customers home. Distilleries that once produced spirits for bars and retailers are switching their operations to support to the health care industry and manufacture hand sanitiser.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>There are, however, a number of industries that are unable to focus on supporting the locked down economy. Some simply cannot continue operation due to the ongoing government restrictions. Instead, taking this time as an opportunity to prepare for the post-covid business and consumer landscape is essential. Following new trends can allow businesses to focus on research and development, allowing for the invention of new business offerings.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>Whatever route a business takes to innovate and adapt through these challenging times, modelling a cashflow with best- and worst-case scenarios is essential. Business owners need to ensure they know how much cash is needed and understand the funding options available to them.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>At <a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time Finance</a>, we have a range of funding solutions to support businesses for the road ahead. For immediate access to additional working capital:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Our suite of <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/loans" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Business Loans</a> provides the cash injection businesses need to keep up with everyday expenditure and make essential investments</li>
	<li>Our <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Invoice Finance</a> solutions unlock additional working capital by releasing up to 90% of the value of unpaid invoices within 24 hours</li>
	<li>Our <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/asset-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Asset Finance </a>solutions allow business owners to invest in vital areas of the business in manageable monthly payments</li>
</ul>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

		<content><![CDATA[<p>As the covid-19 pandemic presents unprecedented challenges, government guidelines to stay indoors and socially distance have dramatically changed the business landscape as we know it. With many businesses forced to close their doors to the public or downsize current operations, businesses of all sizes are being forced to think of new ways of working. In this fast-changing marketplace, now more than ever, innovation and adaption are key for SMEs.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>Small business owners are familiar with the preparations required to manage common business challenges, whether that be a seasonal shift in sales or unexpected employee absences. With the coronavirus crisis unlike anything ever experienced before, in the face of uncertainty many business owners are having to think on their feet. We are already seeing a great number of businesses providing inspiration and seizing the opportunity to evolve.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>When remote working was enforced, we saw a surge in the investment in technology and online presence. In a growing digital world, businesses can continue to offer help and guidance, promote products and services, and simply stay in touch with customers. From using video technology providing virtual consultations or delivering at-home tutorials, businesses have found new ways to communicate with their audiences in the comfort of their own home. It is key to remember that as social beings, our customers value connectivity more so now than ever.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>In a bid for survival, many business owners have no choice but to change their business offering and as a result are discovering new ways of working and generating revenue. Pivoting through adversity requires innovation and adaptation to a new marketplace. We see restaurants and bars that would usually seat and entertain guests now delivering recipe kits and meals directly to their customers home. Distilleries that once produced spirits for bars and retailers are switching their operations to support to the health care industry and manufacture hand sanitiser.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>There are, however, a number of industries that are unable to focus on supporting the locked down economy. Some simply cannot continue operation due to the ongoing government restrictions. Instead, taking this time as an opportunity to prepare for the post-covid business and consumer landscape is essential. Following new trends can allow businesses to focus on research and development, allowing for the invention of new business offerings.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>Whatever route a business takes to innovate and adapt through these challenging times, modelling a cashflow with best- and worst-case scenarios is essential. Business owners need to ensure they know how much cash is needed and understand the funding options available to them.</p>

<p>
	<br>

		<content><![CDATA[<p>There’s no doubt that covid-19 has changed the business landscape as we know it. The crisis acted as a catalyst for innovation and change for SMEs, with businesses from all sectors and of all sizes forced to adapt to new ways of working. With near 25% of businesses ceasing trading altogether during this time*, focus has remained on gaining as much financial aid as possible to stay afloat.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>Now as we start to come out of the other side, SMEs are beginning to rebuild their businesses and bounce back onto the market. In what has always been a fast-changing environment, now more than ever we as financial advisors and funders play a crucial role in both identifying the ways in which the SME sector will continue to evolve, and responding to these new opportunities together.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>Amidst what is still recognised as a cashflow crisis, the need to make sustainable and sensible investments will be key to SMEs across the UK. With almost two-thirds planning to invest new equipment for their business over the next 12 months**, there is a great opportunity for we as financiers to deliver tailored solutions that allow business owners to affordably manage the costs of vital investments that maintain a positive cash flow and support revenue growth.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>Understandably, businesses will be operating at different lifecycles over the coming months and its crucial we acknowledge this. For those who have recently reopened their doors to consumers, investing in assets that adhere to government guidelines will be at the forefront of their mind. Whilst those pivoting in the face of adversity and diversifying their products and services will be looking to invest in new equipment that can support this change. There will also be those businesses who have already adapted are looking to make key investments that can generate new wealth, improve products or services or enable new markets to be developed.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>With the flexibility of maintaining working capital and negotiating affordable payment terms, business owners in all stages of the lifecycle can look towards <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/asset-finance">asset financing as the ideal funding solution</a> in a post covid-19 marketplace. 1pm’s recently launched ‘Low Start’ programme is a great example of the flexibility and affordability delivered through asset finance solutions. With ‘Low Start’ allowing business owners to obtain a lower starting option on their <a href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/equipment-leasing">leased equipment</a>, this seeks to keep cash within the business whilst supporting key investments.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>Covid-19 has thrown monumental challenges to every industry and there can be no doubt that its impact will be long lasting. Despite this, we see potential for a business landscape that is full of opportunity and potential. SMEs are yearning to bounce back from this crisis and the classic “keep calm and carry on” attitude prevails. As business owners continue to seek financial support to drive investment and move their business forward, this is a new beginning for us all to deliver confidence and hope.</p>

		<content><![CDATA[<p>The increasing global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is having a devastating effect on UK businesses. With their futures uncertain as income reduces and cashflow drying up, it is becoming more difficult to trade through these unprecedented times.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>Representing 99% of the UK’s business population, SMEs play a vital role in the growth of our economy. Reflecting on the economic landscape in recent years, we have witnessed positive growth from these businesses with entrepreneurs bringing fresh innovation in products, services and technology to the table. All of which have contributed significantly to both job creation, economic and financial success.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>This is why Time Finance's commitment to backing British businesses through COVID-19 hasn’t faltered. In the face of these testing times, we recognise the important role we as funders play in offering these businesses a lifeline to ensure their survival.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>As a trusted financial partner, <a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time Finance</a> are very much open for business. We continue to offer expertise in a range of cashflow solutions, doing our utmost to provide financial support for creditworthy businesses as well as signpost the necessary guidance and advice. We are actively encouraging businesses to look at all financial solutions available to them so they can maintain a flexible supply of cashflow to protect their businesses.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>What UK business is experiencing now is unparalleled to anything they have experienced before. Income is most likely reducing or has ceased completely, dependent on the nature of their business. However, costs will continue to mount. The support from the Government has been welcomed by all and although some of this support will kick in automatically – Business rates holiday, HMRC payments deferment and Time to Pay schemes – getting access to the loans and grants may not be as easy as the Government has made out or as quickly as required.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>Businesses need to plan their cashflow over the coming months to ensure they know how much cash they need and talk to their funders to see what options are available to them.</p>

		<content><![CDATA[<p>The increasing global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is having a devastating effect on UK businesses. With their futures uncertain as income reduces and cashflow drying up, it is becoming more difficult to trade through these unprecedented times.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>Representing 99% of the UK’s business population, SMEs play a vital role in the growth of our economy. Reflecting on the economic landscape in recent years, we have witnessed positive growth from these businesses with entrepreneurs bringing fresh innovation in products, services and technology to the table. All of which have contributed significantly to both job creation, economic and financial success.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>This is why Time Finance's commitment to backing British businesses through COVID-19 hasn’t faltered. In the face of these testing times, we recognise the important role we as funders play in offering these businesses a lifeline to ensure their survival.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>As a trusted financial partner, <a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time Finance</a> are very much open for business. We continue to offer expertise in a range of cashflow solutions, doing our utmost to provide financial support for creditworthy businesses as well as signpost the necessary guidance and advice. We are actively encouraging businesses to look at all financial solutions available to them so they can maintain a flexible supply of cashflow to protect their businesses.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>What UK business is experiencing now is unparalleled to anything they have experienced before. Income is most likely reducing or has ceased completely, dependent on the nature of their business. However, costs will continue to mount. The support from the Government has been welcomed by all and although some of this support will kick in automatically – Business rates holiday, HMRC payments deferment and Time to Pay schemes – getting access to the loans and grants may not be as easy as the Government has made out or as quickly as required.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>Businesses need to plan their cashflow over the coming months to ensure they know how much cash they need and talk to their funders to see what options are available to them.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>At Time Finance, we have a range of funding solutions to support creditworthy SMEs for the road ahead. For immediate access to additional working capital, our suite of <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/loans" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Business Loans</a> provides the cash injection businesses need to keep up with everyday expenditure. Extended payment terms with suppliers can be debilitating which is why our <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Invoice Finance </a>solutions release up to 90% of the value of unpaid invoices within 24 hours. Our<a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/asset-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&nbsp;Asset</a> and <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/vehicle-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vehicle Finance</a> solutions mean business owners can invest in vital areas of the business in manageable monthly payments, easily forecasted in cashflow management.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>As we move through these challenging times together, it is our mission to ensure we continue to back British businesses ensuring our funding solutions reach those who need it to pull through this difficult period. And when we do, those businesses will be able to reignite their plans and get back to driving our economy forward for all of us knowing they have our continuing support.</p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<p>On a global scale “going green” has become a high priority for all businesses within both new and traditional sectors. &nbsp;Over recent years, Governments and social initiatives have influenced the way businesses plan to operate and the momentum for investing in sustainable projects will only increase. Research* shows that almost two-thirds of SMEs want to develop more environmentally sustainable ways of working with over 20% of them feeling pressured to make such changes by their clients.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>So how can we as funders, help encourage investment in sustainable projects within the UK SME market? Representing 99% of the UK’s business population, SME’s are vital in the generation of jobs and wealth in our economy and without an effective source of finance to support these investments, these businesses could be held back which could prove detrimental in their ability to compete in an ever-changing world. <a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time Finance</a>, believe now more than ever, that collectively advisors and funders have a key role to play in supporting these changes moving forward.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>In recent years, we have invested in expanding our portfolio of financial solutions to support businesses in this ever-changing world. &nbsp;Our focus on understanding our clients’ business, the plans they have and how a flexible funding solution could help them realise their ambitions is at the heart of everything we do. &nbsp;Our clients expect us to be able to offer bespoke funding packages which support all areas of their business and which acts as a launchpad for SME growth and change.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>We offer a multi-product range of business finance solutions to the UK market from <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/asset-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Asset Finance</a>, <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Invoice Finance</a>, <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/loans" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Loans&nbsp;</a>through to <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/vehicle-finance">Vehicle Finance</a>. &nbsp;Our portfolio can support businesses looking to invest in environmentally focussed initiatives. &nbsp;Be that:</p>

<ul>
	<li>a desire to <a href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/equipment-leasing">invest in the latest equipment which could be more energy efficient </a>or produce less waste</li>
	<li>introducing newer or electric vehicles to your fleet to reduce emissions and cut costs</li>
	<li>investing in property or refurbishments to introduce energy-saving initiatives</li>
	<li>to release cashflow to give you the flexibility to make your “green” initiatives happen</li>
</ul>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>Recently, we have supported our clients with their investments in many green initiatives. &nbsp;From investing in the introduction of electric vans and vehicles to their fleets; funding the engineering and construction of climate-resilient infrastructures; as well as funding the introduction of more energy-efficient plant and machinery are just a handful of investments we see businesses looking to make this year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>Whatever the solution be, whether it is a single or a packaged finance facility, when advisors and funders work together to deliver an effective source of finance to clients, it instils the trust and confidence businesses need to drive forward with these key investments. Understanding our clients’ need for change allows us to support them so that they can capitalise on new opportunities and guarantee the future of British businesses.</p>

Representing 99% of the UK’s business population, SME’s are vital in the generation of jobs and wealth in our economy and without an effective source of finance to support these investments, these businesses could be held back which could prove detrimental in their ability to compete in an ever-changing world. <a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time Finance</a>, believe now more than ever, that collectively advisors and funders have a key role to play in supporting these changes moving forward.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>In recent years, we have invested in expanding our portfolio of financial solutions to support businesses in this ever-changing world. &nbsp;Our focus on understanding our clients’ business, the plans they have and how a flexible funding solution could help them realise their ambitions is at the heart of everything we do. &nbsp;Our clients expect us to be able to offer bespoke funding packages which support all areas of their business and which acts as a launchpad for SME growth and change.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>We offer a multi-product range of business finance solutions to the UK market from <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/asset-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Asset Finance</a>, <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Invoice Finance</a>, <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/loans" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Loans&nbsp;</a>through to <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/vehicle-finance">Vehicle Finance</a>. &nbsp;Our portfolio can support businesses looking to invest in environmentally focussed initiatives. &nbsp;Be that:</p>

<ul>
	<li>a desire to <a href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/equipment-leasing">invest in the latest equipment which could be more energy efficient </a>or produce less waste</li>
	<li>introducing newer or electric vehicles to your fleet to reduce emissions and cut costs</li>
	<li>investing in property or refurbishments to introduce energy-saving initiatives</li>
	<li>to release cashflow to give you the flexibility to make your “green” initiatives happen</li>
</ul>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>Recently, we have supported our clients with their investments in many green initiatives. &nbsp;From investing in the introduction of electric vans and vehicles to their fleets; funding the engineering and construction of climate-resilient infrastructures; as well as funding the introduction of more energy-efficient plant and machinery are just a handful of investments we see businesses looking to make this year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>Whatever the solution be, whether it is a single or a packaged finance facility, when advisors and funders work together to deliver an effective source of finance to clients, it instils the trust and confidence businesses need to drive forward with these key investments. Understanding our clients’ need for change allows us to support them so that they can capitalise on new opportunities and guarantee the future of British businesses.</p>

		<content><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance">Invoice Finance</a> is a popular funding solution used by small businesses to improve cash flow. Typically, this type of finance is used by business owners who may face extended payment terms from their customers and require access to additional working capital. Unlike an overdraft, an Invoice Finance facility increases in line with sales rather than being funded to the value of the owners’ house or historical trading records. There are two types of Invoice Finance – <a href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/disclosed-confidential-invoice-finance">Disclosed Invoice Finance and Confidential Invoice Discounting</a>. But, what’s the difference?</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p><a href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/disclosed-confidential-invoice-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Disclosed Invoice Finance</a> enables businesses to access up to 90% of the value of their outstanding invoices within 24 hours of the invoice being raised. In addition, it includes a comprehensive credit control service which enables the business to spend more time speaking to customers about new business rather than outstanding invoices. Disclosed facilities are better suited to businesses that are looking for further support managing their sales ledger as we will provide a designated credit controller who will send out monthly statements and make telephone contact with their customers. <a href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/outsourced-credit-control">The credit control process can be tailored to the business’ exact requirements</a>, leaving the control in the hands of the business owner at all times.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>Confidential <a href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/invoice-discounting">Invoice Discounting provides businesses with a similar cash injection</a> (of up to 90% of the sales ledger) whilst credit control procedures remain in-house so customers will not be aware of our involvement. Businesses best suited to confidential facilities typically have an annual turnover of £500k+, are profitable and can demonstrate that they have the financial processes in place to run the credit control function efficiently.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>Both facilities can be an excellent way to fund MBO’s, MBI’s and acquisitions, as well as replacing traditional bank facilities, as we release up to 90% of the debtor book on day one. To find out more about the Invoice Finance facilities available with <a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time Finance</a>, get in touch today.</p>]]></content>

		<updated><![CDATA[2020-12-07 07:00:00]]></updated>
		<content><![CDATA[<p align="center" style="text-align: left;"><em>Rebrand to unify service offering following series of successful acquisitions&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>1pm plc, the independent specialist finance provider to UK businesses has announced that it has changed its name to <a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>Time Finance plc</strong></a>. &nbsp;As such all companies within the Aim listed 1pm Group will be renamed under the Time Finance brand.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The rebranding reflects the evolution of the business over a number of years, culminating in the recent completion of its buy and build acquisition strategy which has resulted in a portfolio of seven lending and broking businesses. &nbsp;The change to Time Finance supports the strategic objective of becoming a recognised force within the alternative finance market. It unifies the whole group of companies – Onepm Finance, Academy Leasing; Bradgate Business Finance; Intelligent Loans; <a href="https://timefinance.com/time-blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-cashflow-financing">Positive Cashflow Finance</a> and Gener8 Finance - under one consistent brand and identity.
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQq3_wjoSOo&amp;t=2s" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"></a></p>

<p><span class="fr-video fr-dvb fr-draggable" contenteditable="false" draggable="true"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NQq3_wjoSOo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></span>
	<br>
</p>

<p>Ian Smith, CEO of Time Finance comments: “As an ambitious and forward-thinking business, now is the right time to capitalise on our development as a Group. Having pursued a successful acquisition strategy, Time Finance has seen a period of sustained growth resulting in £150m of funding being provided or arranged annually for more than 20,000 businesses across the UK. &nbsp;Rebranding the business to consolidate and strengthen our offering is the next step for us. Time Finance reflects who we are as a business today, as well as our ambition to become a recognised force for UK businesses seeking a fast and flexible choice of finance to support their growth.”</p>

<p>Time Finance is committed to ensuring that UK businesses and their owners can access a multi-product range of funding solutions from <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/asset-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Asset Finance</a>, <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Invoice Finance</a>, <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/loans" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Loans</a> and <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/vehicle-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vehicle Finance</a> to support their growth plans. At a time when businesses are being tested to the limit with the Covid-19 crisis and Brexit imminent, the ability to maintain a healthy cashflow, safeguard jobs, and continue with projected growth plans, is being felt more acutely than ever.</p>

<p>As Ian continues: “At Time Finance we understand that running a business is challenging and funding can mean the difference between standing still or achieving growth. Businesses need to feel confident about their financing in a market where accessing finance isn’t as easy as it could be. &nbsp;As a finance provider we are committed to solving their needs through our range of financial solutions by offering the right solution at the right price, whatever the size of business. This is positive news for our clients and our introducers as we work together to deliver a more comprehensive solution to the needs of UK business”.</p>

<p>The new brand pays homage to the Company’s origins as 1pm (derived from ‘one payment monthly’) and takes its inspiration from the notion that both time and finance are two of the most valuable assets to a successful business. Time Finance will continue to operate from five locations across the UK – Bath, Cardiff, Abingdon, Manchester and Warrington. The Group’s vehicle finance brokerage in Birkenhead providing used vehicle finance to consumers will continue to trade as Car Finance 2U.</p>

		<content><![CDATA[<p align="center" style="text-align: left;"><em>Rebrand to unify service offering following series of successful acquisitions&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>1pm plc, the independent specialist finance provider to UK businesses has announced that it has changed its name to <a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>Time Finance plc</strong></a>. &nbsp;As such all companies within the Aim listed 1pm Group will be renamed under the Time Finance brand.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The rebranding reflects the evolution of the business over a number of years, culminating in the recent completion of its buy and build acquisition strategy which has resulted in a portfolio of seven lending and broking businesses. &nbsp;The change to Time Finance supports the strategic objective of becoming a recognised force within the alternative finance market. It unifies the whole group of companies – Onepm Finance, Academy Leasing; Bradgate Business Finance; Intelligent Loans; <a href="https://timefinance.com/time-blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-cashflow-financing">Positive Cashflow Finance</a> and Gener8 Finance - under one consistent brand and identity.

<p>Ian Smith, CEO of Time Finance comments: “As an ambitious and forward-thinking business, now is the right time to capitalise on our development as a Group. Having pursued a successful acquisition strategy, Time Finance has seen a period of sustained growth resulting in £150m of funding being provided or arranged annually for more than 20,000 businesses across the UK. &nbsp;Rebranding the business to consolidate and strengthen our offering is the next step for us. Time Finance reflects who we are as a business today, as well as our ambition to become a recognised force for UK businesses seeking a fast and flexible choice of finance to support their growth.”</p>

<p>Time Finance is committed to ensuring that UK businesses and their owners can access a multi-product range of funding solutions from <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/asset-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Asset Finance</a>, <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Invoice Finance</a>, <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/loans" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Loans</a> and <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/vehicle-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vehicle Finance</a> to support their growth plans. At a time when businesses are being tested to the limit with the Covid-19 crisis and Brexit imminent, the ability to maintain a healthy cashflow, safeguard jobs, and continue with projected growth plans, is being felt more acutely than ever.</p>

<p>As Ian continues: “At Time Finance we understand that running a business is challenging and funding can mean the difference between standing still or achieving growth. Businesses need to feel confident about their financing in a market where accessing finance isn’t as easy as it could be. &nbsp;As a finance provider we are committed to solving their needs through our range of financial solutions by offering the right solution at the right price, whatever the size of business. This is positive news for our clients and our introducers as we work together to deliver a more comprehensive solution to the needs of UK business”.</p>

<p>The new brand pays homage to the Company’s origins as 1pm (derived from ‘one payment monthly’) and takes its inspiration from the notion that both time and finance are two of the most valuable assets to a successful business. Time Finance will continue to operate from five locations across the UK – Bath, Cardiff, Abingdon, Manchester and Warrington. The Group’s vehicle finance brokerage in Birkenhead providing used vehicle finance to consumers will continue to trade as Car Finance 2U.</p>

		<updated><![CDATA[2020-11-04 09:00:00]]></updated>
		<content><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time Finance</a> have supported a fashion and textile manufacturer with a £400,000 cashflow finance facility as they use the funds to manufacture essential personal protective equipment (PPE) for the NHS.</p>

<p>In a bid to support frontline staff as they battle against the covid-19 health crisis whilst they face a PPE shortage, the team at LS Manufacturing UK Ltd have temporarily switched their operations to focus on helping Britain’s healthcare sector. In a warehouse that normally designs and produces luxury clothing for high-street retailers, the firm has switched its operations to solely manufacturing textiles for the NHS; from non-surgical gowns and protective headwear for frontline staff to cubicle curtains for local NHS trusts.</p>

<p>The well-established West Midlands-based manufacturer has already built a strong reputation for quality, innovation and first-class customer service in the textile and garment manufacturing market, extending their services globally. With operations spanning over 60 years, the creative team have developed expertise in producing a wide range of products, from outerwear to soft furnishings to body armour.</p>

<p>Daljit Mehat, director at LS Manufacturing, commented: “In the face of this global pandemic, we’re proud to have a dedicated team on board who can produce urgently required protective equipment and help safeguard medical professionals. We want to do everything we can to support this national effort and make a real difference. Our funding facility with Time Finance has been fundamental in supporting the ongoing cashflow requirements to produce these garments. As we continue to stay open for business and work through these challenging times, their support and flexibility have ensured we can deliver this project.”</p>

<p>Phil Chesham, Head of <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance">Invoice Finance</a> at Time Finance, added: “It’s a pleasure to support LS Manufacturing as they use their skills and expertise to support our national healthcare service through these extremely challenging times. The work they are completing is a fantastic example of how British businesses can pivot in the face of adversity and come together. We look forward to building a long business relationship with the team and continuing to support them past the covid-19 crisis.”</p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<p>Time Finance has supported its first client under the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS).</p>

<p>Lowton Motor Company Limited, a family-run car dealership, secured the £150,000 CBILS loan to drive the business through the covid-19 crisis and beyond.</p>

<p>Incorporated in 2012, Lowton Motor Company has spent the last 8 years building a strong reputation among its client base for selling high-quality vehicles at affordable prices. Having delivered strong financial results annually, the firm reported an 8-figure turnover in 2019 and had predicted ambitious growth for 2020.</p>

<p>With the pandemic causing the motor finance industry to come to a standstill, the firm was unable to source and deliver vehicles to its customers, which led to an immediate disruption in their sales and cashflow. Facing an inevitable shortfall in income, the business required a cash injection.</p>

<p>Lowton Motor Company were introduced to Time Finance by Sedulo Funding Solutions Limited (“Sedulo”) who sit on Time Finance’s panel of expert brokers. Through their strong relationship, Sedulo and Time Finance were able to swiftly work together to tailor a funding solution that would bolster the motor firm’s cash position during this challenging time.</p>

<p>Alun Winter, Head of Loans at Time Finance, said: “It’s a pleasure to support this fantastic family business. As government restrictions now begin to lift, we are delighted that Lowton Motor Company have a funding solution in place that will support the firm in kickstarting their operations and driving the business forward. We wish them every success on their journey.”</p>

<p>Paul Southern, Director at Lowton Motor Company, commented: “The support from Time Finance has been invaluable. Like most businesses, we had to adapt quickly to changes in operations and a reduction in cashflow when lockdown was enforced. <a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time Finance&nbsp;</a>understood the challenges we were facing and worked quickly to help us secure funding.”</p>

<p>Since the beginning of the covid-19 crisis, Time Finance has been working hard to help its customers through this turbulent period through its portfolio of finance solutions, including <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/asset-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Asset Finance</a>, <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Invoice Finance</a>,<a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/loans" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&nbsp;Loans</a> and <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/vehicle-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vehicle Finance</a>. The launch of the CBILS offering is another opportunity for the company to instil reassurance and confidence back into British business through asset finance and loan facilities.</p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<p>Time Finance has supported a North West recycling firm with a £100,000 loan facility under the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS).</p>

<p>AC Tyres Limited offers sustainable tyre disposal services across the UK. With two premises in Warrington and operating a large fleet of vehicles catering for all tyre collection and disposal needs, the firm accepts and processes over 20,000 tyres per week. Having built a strong foundation of trust with its growing client base over the last 12 years, AC Tyres prides itself on providing a market-leading ethical service.</p>

<p>When government lockdown guidelines resulted in the temporary closure of motor garages, the firm found itself unable to process tyre collections, leading to an immediate disruption in sales and cashflow. Due to the inevitable shortfall in income, the business required a cash injection.</p>

<p>AC Tyres were introduced to the <a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time Finance</a> by Halo Corporate Finance Limited (“Halo”) who sit on Time Finance’s panel of expert brokers. Working closely together, Halo and Time Finance were able to swiftly tailor a funding solution that would bolster the firm’s cash position during this challenging time.</p>

<p>Alun Winter, Head of <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/loans">Loans</a> at Time Finance, said: “The CBILS scheme is a vital lifeline for many SMEs and as a delivery partner we are committed to working with our broker partners to ensure our funding solutions reach those who need it. Stepping in as a supportive funder, we help UK businesses like AC Tyres navigate through these uncertain times and come out of the other side stronger. We are delighted to have been able to support Andrew and the team as they use the funds to support working capital and drive the business forward.”</p>

<p>Andrew Sommerville, Director at AC Tyres, commented: “We initially struggled to find a financier who would listen to us and package a solution that could support us during these challenging times. Time Finance and Halo understood the challenges we were facing and worked quickly to provide us with a funding solution. Within a week or two of our application for a CBILS loan, we received our funding. The quick turnaround has been instrumental in helping us kickstart our operations as government guidelines begin to relax.”</p>

<p>Since the beginning of the covid-19 crisis, Time Finance has been working hard to help its customers through this turbulent period through its portfolio of finance solutions, including Asset Finance, Invoice Finance, Loans and Vehicle Finance. The launch of the CBILS offering is another opportunity for the company to instil reassurance and confidence back into British business through asset finance and loan facilities.</p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time Finance</a> is pleased to announce that lending under the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS) is now live. Working closely with a select panel of the firm’s brokers at this time, Time Finance has now extended access to their CBILS asset finance and loan offering in a bid to support smaller businesses access the funding support they so urgently need.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of the Covid-19 crisis, Time Finance has been working hard to help its customers through this turbulent period through its different lending activities, including <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/asset-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Asset Finance</a>, <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Invoice Finance</a>, <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/loans" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Loans</a> and <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/vehicle-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vehicle Finance</a>.

Non-bank lenders and intermediaries play a key role in making this happen and working collectively in times like this is testament to how we in the business community come together in times of need to support UK businesses. Following our approval for accreditation as a CBILS lending partner, our teams have been working incredibly hard to put in place the processes required to start delivering these finance solutions to SMEs and we are delighted to announce that our lending under the scheme is now live. As we now begin to launch our offering, we are working closely with a select number of broker partners to identify and tailor the support needed to ensure smaller businesses can successfully receive our CBILS funding support and have the cash flow to continue trading in these tough business conditions.”</p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<p>Time Finance has been named Employer of the Year in the 2020 <a href="http://businessleader.co.uk" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Business Leader</a> Awards. The achievement recognises the employer who has created a stimulating and supportive work environment for their staff and has demonstrated a commitment to their welfare.</p>

<p>Since its inception in 1998, the firm has grown its presence across the UK and today employs 170 employees over 6 sites. The firm is led by a senior management team who are dedicated to laying the foundations for a supportive, flexible, and inclusive place to work.</p>

<p>Time Finance regularly engage in new initiatives and projects to support their employees and advocate growth. Their 2020 Talent Leadership Programme was formed to create the next generation of future leaders. Inspiring growth and excellence from within, the annual 12-month programme was developed to enhance the skills of those enrolled, allowing them to deal with real business issues and benefit from an external career and leadership coach as well as one-on-one mentorship from the senior management team.</p>

<p>The creation of a ‘culture club’ was an initiative designed to provide a forum for the “employee voice” to capture sentiment, ideas for improvement and ways to make Time Finance a better place to work. Through local representatives, it ensures that all employees have the opportunity to shape how the business works and to inspire a supportive, inclusive and ambitious culture.</p>

<p><strong>Ian Smith, CEO, Time Finance said:</strong> “We are honoured to be named Employer of the Year as it recognises the commitment we have to our employees, who are at the heart of everything we do. As we continue to grow, this recognition will no doubt help us as we look to build and expand our team of dynamic, passionate, hard-working and fun employees. Our team are empowered to contribute to delivering successful client relationships which in turn delivers growth and opportunities to our employees.”</p>

<p>Through what has been an uncertain and difficult year for many, Time Finance has worked hard to ensure employees continue to feel supported and secure whilst working remotely and within the office.</p>

<p><strong>Smith added:</strong> “The health and wellbeing of our employees is important to us as an employer. 2020 has presented some challenging conditions for the whole UK workplace. At Time Finance, our wellbeing ambassadors have delivered regular check-ins and communications with employees to touch base and see how they are, offer support if needed and to ensure they know we are always here for them. As a business, we have never felt closer and are looking forward to resuming a more normal office life in 2021.”</p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<p>As we prepare to turn the page on 2020 we reflect on the year with the nation’s business owners. The good news? Despite the unprecedented turbulence and ongoing economic uncertainty, there have been clear signs of resilience and innovation.</p>

<p>Following many months of business predictions, projections and promises of bounce-backs around every corner, what was the reality for UK businesses? We saw many sectors devastated by the crisis, finding themselves held back. But, anecdotally, it seemed others were finding ways to adapt, to overcome the hurdles presented during these difficult times.</p>

<p>To discover the reality, we decided to speak directly to those on the ground. In a recent survey, we asked businesses throughout the UK how they were able to navigate through the crisis brought on by Covid-19, and what their learnings were. The findings bring a welcomed degree of reassurance and hope to the industry.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;"><em>70% of UK businesses have either remained stable or flourished in 2020 and two in three are optimistic about the future.</em></h4>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>
	<!--[if !supportAnnotations]-->
	<!--[endif]-->
</p>

<p align="center" style="text-align: left;">Through our recent research, we discovered that 1 in 5 businesses have innovated their offering in response to the crisis and that 45% are currently considering investments in new or improved products and/or services. This matters not only to our industry and other businesses who can learn from this, but to the wider economy and its future.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The even bigger news is that 70% of businesses stated that they remained stable or flourished in 2020 and, when asked to comment on their current outlook, the vast majority answered with a reassuring level of optimism; <em>“Business has grown in the past few months and continues to do so”; “Emerged from the pandemic with a greater focus on what is important to make the business grow”; “Optimistic outlook for 2021 and increased profitability from investments.”</em></p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h4><strong>Lockdown Learnings</strong></h4>

<p>Turning obstacles into opportunities has been a skill borne out of this crisis for many business owners. There has also been a great deal of strength and resilience on display, with some even able to turn the onslaught of challenges into something constructive.</p>

<p>Our research reflects this as the majority of businesses exhibited stability or growth during lockdown. Despite a fifth making significant cutbacks and a third temporarily ceasing trading, 1 in 5 actually innovated their offerings and 1 in 3 continued trading as normal.</p>

<p>Perhaps due to the unprecedented nature of what was happening, the first lockdown resulted in a halting effect for some. As a result, some businesses held back and took stock of their situation before moving forward.</p>

<p>By the time we were entering the next lockdown, businesses weren’t prepared to delay their plans any longer and revealed that they felt more equipped to tackle the challenges in front of them. Our survey revealed that 81% felt better prepared second time around, and 1 in 3 felt that the impact would be less detrimental.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h4><strong>“Cautiously Optimistic”</strong></h4>

<p>Despite a residual degree of uncertainty, business leaders report feeling hopeful and positive as they near the end of 2020. Results reveal 45% continue to have plans to make investments in new products or services. Included in the most sought-after areas for investment were new equipment (13%), marketing (13%) and / or in operational and technological advancements (11%).</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Surviving</strong></h4>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>66% of those surveyed said their business would survive economic uncertainty, with only 4% believing they may not.</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
	<br>
</p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Investing</strong></h4>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>61% feel now is a good time to invest, with only 15% believing the opposite. Additionally, 45% state they’re considering investments in new, improved products or services.</strong></p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;">
	<br>
</h4>

<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Borrowing</strong></h4>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>58% of those surveyed are using existing cashflow to remain buoyant, while 39% are using BBL or CBILS. 23% are using an existing alternative finance provider or looking for one, and just 6% are receiving funding through banks.</strong>
	<!--[if !supportAnnotations]-->
	<!--[endif]-->
</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>Sentiments revealed in the survey included responses such as; “Challenging, but ready to grow”; and “Cautiously optimistic.” Overall, it seems there is a clear trend of cautious optimism across the board, and always a degree of hope.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h4><strong>Rising To The Challenge</strong></h4>

<p>Before this year, never had there been a more time-critical call to arms for funders, to ensure businesses received the lifelines they needed - not only for survival but for growth. In 2020, Time Finance rose to the challenge.</p>

<p>As national lockdowns were enforced, stability and security were at the forefront of every business owner’s mind. Whilst remaining open for business themselves, we worked on a case-by-case basis to issue over £30million in forbearance; ensuring businesses received the right level of support.</p>

<p>After riding out the initial wave, and seeing the pandemic continuing, businesses threw themselves into innovation as the need for investment and growth intensified. In response, we designed and launched a new payment structure across our leasing solution: ‘Low Start’.</p>

<p>Low Start enables businesses to secure finance for investing in vital equipment - in an affordable way - which will prove invaluable far beyond the Covid-19 crisis. Becoming an accredited CBILS lending partner in May also greatly expanded the support we could provide, and helped many businesses to access the cash they so urgently needed.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h4><strong>No Better Time For Finance</strong></h4>

<p>Businesses need to feel confident about their financing, not only to support where they are now but to secure their future.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, we supported fashion and textile manufacturer, <a href="http://www.lsmanufacturing.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">LS Manufacturing</a>, with a £400,000 <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">invoice finance</a> facility enabling them to manufacture essential personal protective equipment (PPE) for the NHS as lockdown hit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Armed with a warehouse and team with expertise in designing and producing luxury clothing for the high-street, the firm switched its operations to solely manufacturing textiles for the NHS. From non-surgical gowns and protective headwear for frontline staff to cubicle curtains for local NHS trusts, LS Manufacturing quickly became an essential provider to the NHS.</p>

<p>Daljit Mehat, director at LS Manufacturing, commented: “In the face of this global pandemic, we’re proud to have a dedicated team on board who can produce urgently required protective equipment and help safeguard medical professionals. Our funding facility with Time Finance has been fundamental in supporting the ongoing cashflow requirements to produce these garments.”</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

		<content><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time Finance</a> and <a href="http://www.startpointfinance.co.uk" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Start Point Finance</a> have supported a creative arts firm with an £80,000 facility under the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (<a href="https://www.british-business-bank.co.uk/ourpartners/coronavirus-business-interruption-loan-scheme-cbils-2/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CBILS</a>). Together, the two financiers were able to swiftly tailor a funding solution that would bolster a creative art group’s cash position during this challenging time and support their plans for innovation and investment.</p>

<p>The group of artists, technicians and designers develop immersive media experiences, including interactive light installations at festivals and concerts. Exhibiting on a global scale, the team have built an excellent reputation for their innovative and visionary installations. The popularity and demand for their creative eye saw turnover double over the past 3 years.</p>

<p>With a national lockdown restricting social gatherings and events, many of their upcoming projects and contracts have been cancelled or delayed. Whilst remaining hopeful that their business partners can recover and re-open later this year, the creative team continue to innovate and work on new projects of their own. To support their ambition, they are looking to re-invest in their stock and equipment during this time. The business turned to Start Point Finance, who sit on Time Finance’s panel of brokers, for financial support and guidance.</p>

<p>Alun Winter, Head of <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/loans" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Loans</a> at Time Finance, said: “Turning obstacles into opportunities for innovation and adaptation has been a skill borne out of this crisis for many business owners. Most are not in a position to necessarily do this alone, and there’s where we step in. It was a pleasure working with Start Point Finance to support this client and we look forward to seeing how we make their growth and development possible.”</p>

		<content><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time Finance</a> are delighted to announce they have supported entrepreneur Dominique Tillen with a £125,000 facility under the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS) to boost her business, <a href="https://brushbaby.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Brush-Baby</a>, during the covid-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>In 2007, Dominique saw a gap in the market to empower parents to look after their children’s dental health and make toothbrushing time fun. As a mother looking to tackle her own daughter’s teething troubles, she designed and developed a chewable toothbrush. From that success, an internationally selling and award-winning business was born. Brush-Baby specialise in early years toothcare and their innovative products help parents give their children good foundations for lifelong healthy teeth. Now manufacturing over 25 teething and toothcare kits and accessories for babies, toddlers and children of all ages, Brush-Baby stocks the shelves of high street retailers, dental practices, and online marketplaces.</p>

<p>When the pandemic enforced lockdowns across the world, the business faced disruption in their manufacturing operations based in China, with further impact on sales from the closure of shopping outlets and high-street stores. With adaptation and innovation second nature to Dominique, she remained determined to get her popular products back into parents reach. She turned to financial intermediary <a href="https://moorgatefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Moorgate Finance</a>, who sit on Time Finance’s panel of brokers, for support. Together the two funding partners packaged a £125,000 CBILS <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/loans" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Loan</a> to bolster the Brush-Baby business and support their continued growth during this time.</p>

<p><strong>Alun Winter, Head of Loans at Time Finance, said:</strong> “It was a pleasure to support Brush-Baby, which is a fantastic success story of innovation and growth. For any business, access to funding during these challenging times is vital. Our CBILS facility will help support Dominique continue to manufacture and expand her product range. We look forward to watching her business continue to adapt and grow through covid-19 and beyond.”</p>

<p><strong>Dominique Tillen, Founder and Managing Director of Brush-Baby, added:</strong> “Despite the challenges we’ve faced in the last 12 months, we want to continue innovating and growing our business where possible. Securing a CBILS loan has been critical in getting our business back on track and supporting the launch of our first re-chargeable range of electric toothbrushes. It’s a really exciting time for us and we really believe our new ‘WildOnes’ range will be a popular hit amongst our growing customer bases. We can’t thank Moorgate Finance for the introduction to Time Finance enough.”</p>

<p><strong>David Fry, Senior Account Manager at Moorgate Finance, said: “</strong>Brush-Baby was a fantastic client to work with. Once I had spoken with Dominique to understand her business, I knew that Time Finance would be the perfect lender for Brush-Baby. I have partnered with Time Finance for several of my clients, and they have always delivered exceptional service. So, I knew Brush-Baby’s application was in safe hands.”</p>

		<updated><![CDATA[2021-03-08 15:30:10]]></updated>
		<content><![CDATA[<p>To celebrate International Women’s Day, we spoke to the inspiring female leaders of Time Finance. Carol Roberts, Lorraine Neyland, Jennifer Bodey, Tansy Cunningham and Holly Mapstone all sit on our Operating Board and drive the strategy for our <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Asset Finance</a>, Risk, Compliance, <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Invoice Finance</a> and HR divisions. With 50% representation on our Board, their knowledge and experience helps drive the success of our organisation and makes <a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time Finance&nbsp;</a>the business it is today.</p>

<p>Carol Roberts, Director of Asset Finance, started her journey in the world of finance over 50 years ago, at a time when a woman’s role in the workforce was bound by perceived limitations. Having built a successful career and long-standing reputation within the asset finance industry, Carol uses her own personal experiences to empower other women in business to drive positive change. She says:</p>

<p><em><strong>"I learned very early on that having someone notice something in you and believe in you can make all the difference. I owe much of my success to the support network I had around me and for this reason am passionate about using my own experiences and position to celebrate and elevate the women around me. International Women’s Day is such a significant day for our industry as it showcases the positive steps we have already taken as well as what we can do for our younger generations and emerging business leaders to make this a more inclusive and inspiring place."</strong></em></p>

<p>Lorraine Neyland, Director of Risk, has worked within the financial services industry for over 30 years, building an impressive reputation within risk management. With extensive experience managing and leading teams at large UK firms, Lorraine inspires many of the employees within our organisation to act with diligence and integrity always. She says:</p>

<p><strong><em>"As we celebrate another International Women’s Day, I want to take a moment to celebrate how much our industry has transformed over the years. Having started my career in Risk over 32 years ago, in what was very much a man’s world, I’ve witnessed a lot of changes over the course of that time. Most notably, how rewarding it has been for women such as myself to go against the grain, climb up the ranks and have a voice at the table where important decisions are made. In 2021, there are more and more women entering and thriving in this field than ever before, and it’s a pleasure to see."</em></strong></p>

<p>Jennifer Bodey, Director of Governance &amp; Compliance and Company Secretary, spent two decades working within the FCA during an increasingly active time within the Compliance sector. She now brings her wealth of expertise and knowledge to support our financial governance and compliance. Alongside this, Jennifer supports and provides one-to-one mentorship to some of the female employees within our organisation, reflecting on her own personal experiences to support career growth and personal development. She says:</p>

<p><em><strong>"The modern-day challenges working families are facing have been particularly highlighted during the pandemic - having to juggle home schooling, work, and family life. For me, it’s been an incredible opportunity to act as a role model for my children, particularly my daughter, and demonstrate the contribution women can make in the workplace. More so, the personal fulfilment that can be achieved from a meaningful career. I’ve always been passionate about helping women reach their full potential and the pandemic has shown me it’s never too early to start those conversations. As the saying goes, “Here’s to strong women: May we know them. May we be them. May we raise them.”</strong></em></p>

<p>Tansy Cunningham, Head of Invoice Finance Operations, has built a credible career in financial services, having worked her way up the ranks and orchestrating an impressive growth strategy at the firms she has worked at. Her entrepreneurial spirit and dynamic approach to business makes Tansy a natural role model for many of the women at Time Finance. She says:</p>

<p><strong><em>"More and more women are stepping up into leadership positions and driving positive change across our industry. International Women’s Day is a fantastic opportunity to celebrate and honour those women bringing enthusiasm, drive, and tenacity to the table. In what has been a heavily male dominated environment for many years, it’s great to see diversity and inclusivity start to move in the right direction. But, some diversity issues do remain and in some businesses women continue to be underrepresented. This is something I am passionate about driving change for and tackling."</em></strong></p>

<p>Holly Mapstone, Director of HR, was one of the first 5 employees who started at Time Finance and it has been a pleasure to see her grow alongside the business. Now heading up our HR division, Holly inspires an inclusive and supportive culture at Time Finance and is passionate about ensuring every employee has the opportunity to reach their full potential. She says:</p>

<p><strong><em>"International Women’s Day is an important opportunity to recognise the incredible strides women have made, the barriers they’ve overcome and the impact they’ve made. But, to continue creating lasting change in our industry, we need to continue taking practical steps to improve diversity and inclusion in the workplace. I’m passionate about achieving this at Time Finance by empowering women to take on new challenges, to step outside of their comfort zone and to learn and grow with us."</em></strong></p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time Finance</a> are pleased to announce that Matt Harding is taking up a Relationship Manager role within their <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Invoice Finance</a> division.</p>

<p>Matt brings over 10 years’ commercial finance experience to the role. Starting his career as a client relationship manager, Matt was responsible for building personal and supportive relationships with invoice finance clients. More recently as a business development manager, Matt worked closely with UK business owners to package bespoke financial solutions that would support day-to-day cashflow requirements, growth and innovation. &nbsp;</p>

<p>With a strong broker network in place in Essex and the surrounding areas, Matt will continue to support new business introductions in this region. His new role will allow him to not only manage the ongoing relationships with clients but also to initially set up and tailor their funding solution.</p>

<p><strong>Speaking of the move, Matt said:&nbsp;</strong>“Having moved from a client-facing role to a business development role it enabled me to share my stories of how invoice finance has helped the clients I have managed, giving prospective clients new to invoice finance a real-life view of the benefits it can deliver.</p>

<p>With the Time Finance business now able to offer an expanded range of funding solutions, I’m looking forward to helping our clients access the finance they need to put growth plans into place as well as managing their ongoing relationship with us.”</p>

<p>Time Finance’s Invoice Finance solutions can relieve pressure on cashflow and give businesses the headroom to grow at a pace that suits them. By releasing up to 90% of the value of unpaid invoices, business owners can access additional working capital and use the funds to support day-to-day cashflow requirements as well as innovation and growth. Their Invoice Finance facilities range from £10,000 to £2.5million, with the added flexibility that their facilities can grow alongside a business.</p>

<p><strong>Tansy Cunningham, Head of Invoice Finance Operations at Time Finance, commented:</strong> “Matt has a natural ability to forge strong relationships with clients and is known for establishing lasting connections based on clear communication, responsiveness and trust. &nbsp;As we continue to strive towards delivering a market-leading service for our clients, we are delighted to see him take on this new role and support us in achieving this.”</p>

<p>Time Finance also specialise in the provision or arrangement of <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/asset-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Asset Finance</a>, <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/loans" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Loan</a> and <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/vehicle-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vehicle Finance</a> solutions. Since the beginning of the pandemic, Time Finance has been committed to working hard to help their customers through this turbulent period. &nbsp;Accredited as a CBILS provider and the introduction of a Low start product all served to demonstrate this commitment.</p>]]></content>

		<slug><![CDATA[zest-education-aim-to-be-top-of-the-class-after-securing-funding-boost]]></slug>
		<published><![CDATA[2021-04-27 08:46:51]]></published>
		<updated><![CDATA[2021-04-27 08:46:51]]></updated>
		<content><![CDATA[<p>Zest Education are set to put ambitious plans in motion and create jobs having secured a six-figure funding facility with <a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time Finance</a>. The cash injection will help to drive recruitment in the education sector after a disruptive year, and in turn help students thrive.</p>

<p>The Midlands-based recruitment agency initially started working with Time Finance back in 2015, just one year after they were incorporated. Managing Director of Zest, Brad Johnson, who had spent 10 years in the recruitment sector, grasped an opportunity to set up his own firm. As business grew, he recognised the need to find a funding solution to support his business’ cashflow. He secured an initial £50k invoice finance facility with Time Finance who were supportive of Brad’s growth strategy for the business.</p>

<p>However, like many, Zest found they were knocked off course by Covid-19 and the restrictions imposed by the Government. The closure of schools back in March 2020 left many educational bodies reluctant to follow through on recruitment plans. This impact meant cashflow was drying up and with a third lockdown in place, Brad approached Time Finance who were happy to increase his facility to £75k to support the business through this time.</p>

<p>Over the course of the pandemic, Zest remained committed to stay open for business to support clients and candidates who found themselves in search of recruitment. It’s a strategy which has paid off as they find themselves with an increased portfolio of top-level candidates looking for new roles and are able to swiftly secure placements and drive new business.</p>

<p>Now, 12 months after government restrictions were first enforced and in a stronger position than ever before, the business has secured a further increase in their facility to £150k to support the ambitious growth plans Brad has to drive the business forward.</p>

<p><strong>Phil Chesham, Head of&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>Invoice Finance&nbsp;</strong></a><strong>at Time Finance, said:</strong> “Zest Education are a fantastic client and a real success story. In what has been an incredibly challenging time for all businesses, Brad’s determination to adapt and overcome is applaudable. It’s an absolute pleasure to see his business grow year on year and to support his journey.”</p>

<p>Having gone from strength to strength over the last 7 years, Zest now employs 10 members of staff and has a leading reputation for providing high-calibre candidates to schools across the Midlands.</p>

<p>With a secure funding solution in place and a committed funding partner by their side, they have set a goal to double the size of their business by 2022 and a workforce of 20 employees. Having recently secured new larger premises in Staffordshire to support their expansion and commenced plans to recruit additional members of the team, progress is well under way.</p>

<p><strong>As Brad comments:</strong> “We wouldn’t be where we are today without the support of Time Finance. Over what has been a turbulent 12 months, our relationship on both a personal and professional level has only strengthened during this time. They have been understanding and accommodating, accessible when I need to speak to key decision makers and flexible with my changing demands. I can’t thank them enough.”</p>

<p>Matt brings nearly a decade of <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/asset-finance">Asset Finance</a> experience to the role.

Having spent over two years with Time Finance in a similar role he is now stepping up to lead the Vendor Finance sales team and help to grow their national sales presence.</p>

<p>Speaking of his promotion, Matt said “As UK Businesses push up a gear to get back on track post lockdown restrictions, they are keen to invest and upscale their operations. Business owners recognise now is a good time to invest in vital business equipment but want the peace of mind that they can afford the investment at what is an uncertain time for many. I’ve seen how Asset Finance can make a difference to our clients’ growth strategies without tying up much needed cashflow and am looking forward to leading the sales team as we share the benefits of Vendor Finance with many more UK businesses.</p>

<p>Financing the purchase of vital business equipment can be a challenge for many businesses and this impacts on those firms looking to increase their revenue through sales of the equipment. <a href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/vendor-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vendor Finance</a> solutions empowers UK businesses to make vital investments by offering them a range of flexible asset financing options.</p>

<p>Working closely with their vendor partners to tailor the finance packages available, Time Finance help UK businesses to invest affordably by spreading the cost of payments over time and to relieve cashflow pressures.”</p>

<p><strong>Carol Roberts, Head of Asset Finance at Time Finance, commented:</strong> “We are delighted to see Matt step up to this new role as he uses his wealth of experience to manage our vendor network and our growing sales team. Matt has a natural ability to forge strong relationships with vendors and their customers and has a fantastic track record of delivering solutions that inspire innovation and growth.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Asset Finance continues to be a valuable and staple finance solution for business who rely on equipment to make business happen and we have ambitious growth objectives to continue enabling UK businesses to gain easy access to it.”</p>

		<content><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time Finance</a> has been nominated for Asset Finance Lender of the Year in the SME Funding Awards 2021, alongside four other industry leaders.</p>

<p>An annual highlight in the financial services industry calendar, the awards recognise the very best of the SME lending sector and celebrate those that provide an exceptional service and innovative approach to supporting UK business owners.</p>

<p><strong>Carol Roberts, Director of&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/asset-finance"><strong>Asset Finance</strong></a><strong>, reflects on the significance of this nomination:</strong> “What a fantastic achievement just to be nominated for the Asset Finance Lender of the Year! This is a testament to the hard-working and dynamic team we have here, who are passionate about supporting businesses and making a real difference to their success. We look forward to being part of the Awards ceremony and wish the other finalists the best of luck.”</p>

<p>Time Finance offer a broad portfolio of funding solutions and their Asset Finance solution aims to inspire innovation and growth. Business owners can access a range of flexible repayment options, allowing them to spread the cost of key investments over time. Working in partnership with intermediaries, their solutions are tailored to support each individual business in achieving their goals with confidence and the peace of mind that payments are affordable and over a term which suits them.</p>

<p>Through what has been an uncertain and challenging year for many, Time Finance has worked hard to assist existing clients with forbearance support where required. &nbsp;In April last year, amid what was a difficult time for many businesses, the firm launched ‘Low Start’– which enabled business owners to secure lease funding to invest in vital business equipment but with a new payment structure which sees significantly smaller payments at the beginning of their agreement.</p>

<p><strong>Carol Roberts, added:</strong> “Our priority is and always will be supporting business owners access the funding they so urgently need during these incredibly difficult times. In our industry, we widely recognise that having a supportive and relationship-driven funder on your side can mean the difference between success and failure. The current climate has emphasised this point more plainly than ever. We're proud to continue supporting our existing clients and new businesses as they emerge from the pandemic stronger than before.”</p>

<p>Carol recently sat down with Funding Bay to share how Time Finance intend to continue supporting SMEs whilst allying any fears they may when it comes to committing to funding to get their businesses back on track. <a href="https://fundingbay.co.uk/time-finance-asset-finance-lender-of-the-year-nominee/">You can read the full interview here.</a></p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;">2 in 3 businesses feel optimistic</h4>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>In what has been a chaotic 12 months, the financial pressures to stay open for business overwhelmed small business owners. Yet, what should have mounted and defeated many, in turn acted as a catalyst for strength and resilience. Many were able to innovate quickly to adapt to the restrictions enforced – launch new products and services onto the market, build their digital presence and generate new streams of income. Now, with light at the end of the tunnel, we wanted to understand how businesses are feeling about the future.</p>

<p>We’re pleased to report our findings are positive, which should deliver a real sense of pride to the UK SME market. Many reported being in a strong position for recovery and are looking optimistically to the 12 months ahead. The findings also come as the Bank of England upgrades its growth forecast to 7.25% for 2021 from 5%, in better-than-expected bounce back results.</p>

<p>In our recently conducted research, we spoke with both small business owners and their trusted financial advisors to uncover the attitudes of those impacted by the pandemic. The good news is that 2 in 3 businesses are optimistic about the future and report feeling 'energetic', 'positive', 'excited' and 'hopeful' as they bounce back onto the market.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;">"We have gone from strength to strength"</h4>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Reflecting on the year just gone, respondents commented: "We have managed to retain all staff without having to furlough anyone."; "We have gone from strength to strength."; "Our business has continued to grow despite the challenges we have all faced."</p>

<p>With many looking to get back into the workplace, 1 in 3 business owners are now planning a speedy return to capitalise on demand. Additionally, 40% are looking to embark on a recruitment drive to increase their workforce and bring fresh talent into the firms.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A real sense of success can be felt amongst business owners when reflecting on their achievements over the course of the pandemic - not just in their fight for survival, but their dedication to staff retention and, for some, even experiencing substantial growth.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Zest Education is just one client of ours, that despite being knocked off course by Covid-19, is now putting ambitious plans in motion and creating new jobs. Over the course of the pandemic, Zest Education faced the strain of prospective clients that were reluctant to follow through on recruitment plans. Nevertheless, Zest remained committed to stay open for business to support candidates who found themselves in search of a new role. With the full backing of the team at <a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time Finance</a>, the education recruiter had its funding facility tripled to £150,000 in those 12 months. With a substantially increased funding facility in place, Zest was able use the additional funds to prepare for a new business drive and in doing so, swiftly secure placements. Now, in a stronger position than ever before, Zest Education can look to enjoy further growth and success.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;">"Our goal to double the size of our business by 2022, and our workforce of 20 employees, is well underway"</h4>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>Brad Johnson, Managing Director at Zest Education, said: “With a secure funding solution in place and a committed funding partner by our side, we’re feeling excited and optimistic about the coming months. Our goal to double the size of our business by 2022, and our workforce of 20 employees, is well underway, having recently secured larger premises in Staffordshire to support our expansion and commenced plans to recruit additional members of the team.”</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;">We need to recognise those hit hardest, both financially and mentally in this time</h4>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>As the backbone to our economy, it’s great to see such optimism overall and confidence growing again. That said, it’s important to recognise those hit hardest, both financially and mentally in this time. Alongside the growing optimism we’re seeing, for many a sense of negativity, worry and concern was also highlighted. 25% of respondents reported feeling 'nervous', 'depressed', 'worried', 'stressed', 'on edge', 'fed-up', 'despondent', and 'numb' as we start to emerge from the pandemic.</p>

<p>Our industry has played a critical role in this pandemic; not only trying to tackle concerns presented by clients but often providing support, peace of mind and advice to business owners when they most needed it. Our findings show more plainly than ever that that support from both funders and brokers needs to continue.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Financial partners have a moral obligation to demonstrate compassion and understanding, and to stand by clients when they experience a bump in the road. At Time Finance, we worked hard to ease the financial pressure our clients were facing with support options in the form of forbearance, payment holidays and additional headroom facilities alongside our existing portfolio of solutions – <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/asset-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Asset Finance</a>, <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Invoice Finance</a>, <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/loans" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Loans</a> and <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/vehicle-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vehicle Finance</a>. However, we recognised this wasn’t enough. Creative solutions – such as our bespoke payment solution to drive affordable investment ‘Low Start’ – meant many businesses could pick themselves up in a difficult time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;">Ensuring a sufficient level of working capital in the business will be a priority</h4>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>As repayments on those government loans commence imminently, and with furlough soon grinding to a halt, business owners need to ensure they have a sufficient level of working capital in their business. With confidence back in the economy and businesses hungry to get back on track faster than expected, financial support will be key to the delivery of growth plans and boosting further optimism.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a leading independent alternative finance provider, we can offer a broad range of flexible financial solutions to support the growth plans of UK businesses across the country. This broad range of choice ensures businesses can access a single or multi product funding solution that’s right for them. To find out more, get in touch with a member of our team today.&nbsp;</p>

		<content><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;">2 in 3 businesses feel optimistic</h4>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>In what has been a chaotic 12 months, the financial pressures to stay open for business overwhelmed small business owners. Yet, what should have mounted and defeated many, in turn acted as a catalyst for strength and resilience. Many were able to innovate quickly to adapt to the restrictions enforced – launch new products and services onto the market, build their digital presence and generate new streams of income. Now, with light at the end of the tunnel, we wanted to understand how businesses are feeling about the future.</p>

<p>We’re pleased to report our findings are positive, which should deliver a real sense of pride to the UK SME market. Many reported being in a strong position for recovery and are looking optimistically to the 12 months ahead. The findings also come as the Bank of England upgrades its growth forecast to 7.25% for 2021 from 5%, in better-than-expected bounce back results.</p>

<p>In our recently conducted research, we spoke with both small business owners and their trusted financial advisors to uncover the attitudes of those impacted by the pandemic. The good news is that 2 in 3 businesses are optimistic about the future and report feeling 'energetic', 'positive', 'excited' and 'hopeful' as they bounce back onto the market.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;">"We have gone from strength to strength"</h4>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Reflecting on the year just gone, respondents commented: "We have managed to retain all staff without having to furlough anyone."; "We have gone from strength to strength."; "Our business has continued to grow despite the challenges we have all faced."</p>

<p>With many looking to get back into the workplace, 1 in 3 business owners are now planning a speedy return to capitalise on demand. Additionally, 40% are looking to embark on a recruitment drive to increase their workforce and bring fresh talent into the firms.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A real sense of success can be felt amongst business owners when reflecting on their achievements over the course of the pandemic - not just in their fight for survival, but their dedication to staff retention and, for some, even experiencing substantial growth.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Zest Education is just one client of ours, that despite being knocked off course by Covid-19, is now putting ambitious plans in motion and creating new jobs. Over the course of the pandemic, Zest Education faced the strain of prospective clients that were reluctant to follow through on recruitment plans. Nevertheless, Zest remained committed to stay open for business to support candidates who found themselves in search of a new role. With the full backing of the team at <a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time Finance</a>, the education recruiter had its funding facility tripled to £150,000 in those 12 months. With a substantially increased funding facility in place, Zest was able use the additional funds to prepare for a new business drive and in doing so, swiftly secure placements. Now, in a stronger position than ever before, Zest Education can look to enjoy further growth and success.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;">"Our goal to double the size of our business by 2022, and our workforce of 20 employees, is well underway"</h4>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>Brad Johnson, Managing Director at Zest Education, said: “With a secure funding solution in place and a committed funding partner by our side, we’re feeling excited and optimistic about the coming months. Our goal to double the size of our business by 2022, and our workforce of 20 employees, is well underway, having recently secured larger premises in Staffordshire to support our expansion and commenced plans to recruit additional members of the team.”</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;">We need to recognise those hit hardest, both financially and mentally in this time</h4>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>As the backbone to our economy, it’s great to see such optimism overall and confidence growing again. That said, it’s important to recognise those hit hardest, both financially and mentally in this time. Alongside the growing optimism we’re seeing, for many a sense of negativity, worry and concern was also highlighted. 25% of respondents reported feeling 'nervous', 'depressed', 'worried', 'stressed', 'on edge', 'fed-up', 'despondent', and 'numb' as we start to emerge from the pandemic.</p>

<p>Our industry has played a critical role in this pandemic; not only trying to tackle concerns presented by clients but often providing support, peace of mind and advice to business owners when they most needed it. Our findings show more plainly than ever that that support from both funders and brokers needs to continue.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Financial partners have a moral obligation to demonstrate compassion and understanding, and to stand by clients when they experience a bump in the road. At Time Finance, we worked hard to ease the financial pressure our clients were facing with support options in the form of forbearance, payment holidays and additional headroom facilities alongside our existing portfolio of solutions – <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/asset-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Asset Finance</a>, <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Invoice Finance</a>, <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/loans" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Loans</a> and <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/vehicle-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vehicle Finance</a>. However, we recognised this wasn’t enough. Creative solutions – such as our bespoke payment solution to drive affordable investment ‘Low Start’ – meant many businesses could pick themselves up in a difficult time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;">Ensuring a sufficient level of working capital in the business will be a priority</h4>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>As repayments on those government loans commence imminently, and with furlough soon grinding to a halt, business owners need to ensure they have a sufficient level of working capital in their business. With confidence back in the economy and businesses hungry to get back on track faster than expected, financial support will be key to the delivery of growth plans and boosting further optimism.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a leading independent alternative finance provider, we can offer a broad range of flexible financial solutions to support the growth plans of UK businesses across the country. This broad range of choice ensures businesses can access a single or multi product funding solution that’s right for them. To find out more, get in touch with a member of our team today.&nbsp;</p>

		<content><![CDATA[<p>Two thirds of businesses are feeling optimistic about the future according to the latest survey by alternative finance provider, <a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time Finance.</a> The findings come as the Bank of England upgrades its growth forecast to 7.25% for 2021 from 5% in better-than-expected bounce back results.</p>

<p>The Time Finance survey found that business owners were feeling 'energetic', 'positive', 'excited' and 'hopeful' as they look to the future. 1 in 3 business owners are planning a speedy return to the workplace to capitalise on demand as lockdown restrictions end, and 40% of which stated they are currently embarking on a recruitment drive to bring fresh talent into their firms. Respondent comments included:</p>

<p>"We have gone from strength to strength."</p>

<p>"We have managed to retain all staff without having to furlough anyone."</p>

<p>"Our business has continued to grow despite the challenges we have all faced.</p>

<p><strong>E</strong><strong>d Rimmer, Interim CEO at Time Finance, comments:</strong> “A real sense of pride can be felt amongst business owners when talking about their achievements over the past 12 months - not just for surviving, but for retaining staff and, for some, even experiencing substantial growth. It’s great to see such optimism overall and confidence growing again amongst these businesses who are the backbone of our economy.”</p>

<p>Zest Education are one business who, despite being knocked off course by Covid-19, are looking forward to the future and are set to put ambitious plans in motion and create new jobs. Over the course of the pandemic, Zest Education faced prospective clients reluctant to follow through on recruitment plans. Nevertheless, they remained committed to stay open for business to support candidates who found themselves in search of a new role. Backed by their funder, Time Finance, the firm were able to triple their funding facility from to £150,000 in this time and use the funds to prepare for a new business drive and in doing so, swiftly secure placements. Now, in a stronger than ever before, the business looks towards a bright future ahead.</p>

<p><strong>Brad Johnson, Managing Director at Zest Education, said:</strong> “With a secure funding solution in place and a committed funding partner by our side, we’re feeling excited and optimistic about the coming months. Our goal to double the size of our business by 2022 and our workforce of 20 employees is well underway, having recently secured new larger premises in Staffordshire to support our expansion and commenced plans to recruit additional members of the team.”</p>

<p><strong>Rimmer, adds:&nbsp;</strong>“It’s essential that as we ‘build back better’ we don’t forget those that have been hit hardest, both financially and mentally by the pandemic. Those on the ground within the financial services industry have played a critical role in this pandemic; not only trying to tackle concerns presented by their clients but often providing support, peace of mind and advice to business owners when they most desperately needed it. That support needs to continue.”</p>

<p>Alongside the positive findings of optimism, negative feelings were also reported by 25% of respondents. Amongst the positive answers were the words 'nervous', 'depressed', 'worried', 'stressed', 'on edge', 'fed-up', 'despondent', and 'numb'.</p>

<p>“As first-rate funders we have a moral obligation to stand by our clients when there’s a bump in the road and it’s important to demonstrate compassion where possible. &nbsp;Support in the form of forbearance, payment holidays and additional headroom go some way to ease the financial pressure, as do creative solutions – such as “Low Start” launched during the pandemic to provide a bespoke payment solution to drive affordable investment.</p>

<p>“With loan repayments pending and furlough phasing out, ensuring a sufficient level of working capital in the business will be a priority to support the delivery of growth plans. We are seeing an increase in the number of firms looking to access a range of finance solutions to support cashflow or invest in vital equipment, so I echo the optimism of our survey findings and have every confidence that the economy will get back on track faster than expected.”</p>

		<content><![CDATA[<p>To mark the end of Mental Health Week, we want to highlight the importance of tackling the mental health crisis in the business community and how we can all play our part to remove the stigmas and create a supportive culture.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>8 in 10 SMEs experience symptoms of poor mental health</strong></h4>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>Whilst poor mental health has long been an issue in the business community, sadly the global pandemic has only exacerbated this problem. In fact, research reveals that 8 in 10 business owners have experienced symptoms of poor mental health in the last year, including panic attacks, anxiety, an inability to focus, depression and disrupted sleep. Additionally, more than three-quarters (78%) report their most significant concern is maintaining cashflow in their business*.</p>

<p>The financial implications caused by the government restrictions have crippled many businesses, and for some business owners trying to weather the storm, the last 12 months have simply been a fight for survival. To accompany this, we’ve experienced greater accessibility through modern technology and exposure to longer working hours. It’s no surprise the mental health of many is under such strain.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>The ripple effect</strong></h4>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>The financial services industry continues to play a critical role in this pandemic; providing financial support, peace of mind and advice to business owners when they most desperately need it. However, we mustn’t forget that the past year has also been extremely challenging for our internal teams. The increased demand for forbearance inevitably comes with added stress to ensure the right level of support is delivered.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Finding balance</strong></h4>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>The first positive step forward is to recognise the issue at hand so we can come together and tackle the mental health crisis. Organisations of every size should be well equipped with the tools required to support their employees with mental health concerns and prevent them from being worsened. With the right training, internal teams should be in a position to recognise symptoms, encourage open communication and signpost professional support.</p>

<p>By equipping staff with the tools to manage their own mental health concerns, they also become more attuned to those that may be experienced by clients. At<a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Time Finance</a>, we hope to cultivate a supportive and mindful culture which removes the stigmas around mental health in the financial services and small business communities. We believe now is the time to make a difference.</p>

	<br>
</p>

<h3 align="center"><strong>Optimism and Asset Finance go hand in hand</strong></h3>

<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>

<p><em>“It’s beginning to feel more normal” seems to be a common statement being voiced by many as we move at speed through the second part of 2021. The vaccine success story has played its part and injected a boost of optimism in businesses across the country as they continue to emerge from the restrictions that were enforced. Carol Roberts, Director of&nbsp;</em><em>Asset</em><em>&nbsp;at Time Finance, predicts the industry’s prospects will be blooming alongside the flowers this summer.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Looking Up. Looking Forward.&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Uncertainty will never be good for business, and we’ve certainly had our fill of this for the last 15 months. Whilst the pandemic still makes for strong headlines, thankfully with the vaccine rollout making enormous strides, there are promising signs that despite restrictions not easing as planned on 21st June, there is an end in sight.</p>

<p>It seems that businesses are driving forward with their post-covid comeback.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Activity in <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/asset-finance">the Asset Finance market is ramping up</a> and the type of activity we’re seeing suggests that some of those industries who had been forced to batten down the hatches are already on the move.</p>

<p>The hard asset market, which throughout the pandemic held fast and strong momentum, is gearing up once again. This is no real surprise considering the sectors that would typically invest in large machinery or manufacturing equipment, always tend to hold steady in a downturn. We saw the likes of manufacturing and construction continue to carry out new work to keep the country operating during this time. Not forgetting vans either - delivery drivers have been in high demand as the dominance of online deliveries surged while we all spent more time at home.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Softly softly?</strong></h3>

<p style="text-align: center;">
	<br>
</p>

<p>Conversely, the soft asset market experienced a slowdown. Again, given the circumstances, this comes as no great shock. When you consider that some of these investments - which might include coffee machines, shop fit-outs or gym equipment - sit within the hospitality, retail and leisure industries, it’s little wonder that investments here had taken a dip.</p>

<p>There has understandably been an air of caution from businesses, as well as from some funders, when certain sectors haven’t been unable to open their doors for the last 15 months. Many SMEs have been living off government assistance and the appetite to grow beyond this has been stifled.</p>

<p>One area that has been a particular exception to the rule, however, is restaurateurs turning their hand at takeaways. We've all witnessed countless restaurants diversifying in recent months by offering cook-at-home food boxes and offering their services for delivery for the first time. While just one specific industry, it is nonetheless an example of necessary innovation that has occurred in a time of crisis but will now change the face of its industry post-pandemic. A great new way to access the market has been identified and consumer habits have changed in turn - is turning a back on this route to market likely? I think not.</p>

<p>Now with more restrictions eased, it’s great to see the soft asset market once again on the rise, with an increase in new business from companies determined to come out stronger at the other side - hospitality being one of them. With light at the end of the tunnel, a fear of being left behind is as overwhelming as ever and firms are investing in refurbishments, for instance, to give themselves every chance. When the economy is fully re-open and new markets emerge, those who have set themselves apart from the competition will thrive. So, what are we waiting for?</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Time to get moving.</strong></h3>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Any lack in confidence is inextricably linked to governmental announcements and many businesses have waited for those milestone dates. Despite restrictions not easing as planned, we still see a strong focus from business leaders to build up for the future. A ‘time to get moving’ message wide-spread across the country and many businesses are gearing themselves up for a new beginning.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Keep up the pace.</strong></h3>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>Innovation is key to staying ahead of the competition and not getting left behind.</p>

<p>A survey we conducted recently demonstrates this fact, with many businesses telling us that now is a good time to invest in growth with that investment stretching across all parts of their business.</p>

<p>There is a growing awareness that those who haven’t already innovated their offering, should be looking to do so. Businesses are now thinking more optimistically, looking ahead, and asking ‘what next and how do I build back better?’ Whether that's via infrastructural adaptations or with new tools to improve team performance, leaders we work with are taking steps to put themselves in the best possible position for recovery and new opportunities.</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Is Asset your answer?</strong></h3>

		<content><![CDATA[<p>As demand for UK staycations increase, family-owned Lakes Carpet Cleaning Solutions, are in a strong position to capitalise on the surge in new business opportunities having secured a six-figure funding line from Time Finance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lakes Carpet Cleaning Solutions specialise in carpet and upholstery cleaning to hotels and holiday homes across the Lake District. However, like many businesses, they found themselves knocked off course by COVID-19. With the government lockdown restrictions forcing the hospitality and leisure industry to close its doors to the British public, the demand for their cleaning services reduced significantly. With fewer contracts to fulfil, cashflow became a concern and the need for a flexible funding solution to support them through the crisis was sought.</p>

<p>Having taken advice from their broker, they were introduced to <a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time Finance</a> who were delighted to provide a £100,000 <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Invoice Finance</a> solution. With sufficient cashflow in place, the business was able to meet its fixed costs which remained despite the drop in turnover. It enabled them to see the crisis through and prepare themselves for the re-opening of the hospitality and leisure sector which has left them well-placed to capitalise on the expected surge of demand for their services. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Marcus Osgerby, Director at Lakes Carpet Cleaning Solutions, said:</strong> “It’s such a relief to have the support of a funder like Time Finance behind us. Over the course of a tough and uncertain year, having access to a flexible supply of funds and the commitment from Time Finance gave us peace of mind and helped us remain optimistic and hopeful for the future. Now, with the end in sight and business going back to normal, we’re in a strong position to take on new contracts and opportunities with confidence. We can’t thank Time Finance enough.”</p>

<p>Invoice Finance can help business owners like Lakes Carpet Cleaning Solutions rebuild with confidence. By releasing funds otherwise tied up in unpaid invoices, businesses are no longer held back by a lack of cashflow. With facilities ranging between £10,000 and £2.5million, Invoice Finance can help businesses of all sizes.</p>

<p><strong>Andy Hume, Head of Sales (North) for Invoice Finance at Time Finance, said:</strong> “Lakes Carpet Cleaning Solutions are ideally placed to capitalise on the focus on additional cleanliness following the Covid pandemic. It’s a real boost for their business and we are determined to help. We are a relationship-driven funder and it’s important to us that we understand our clients‘ position so that we can deliver a solution that’s right for their business in good times and bad. Marcus’ enthusiasm and positivity during the last year is commendable. Our funding solution has contributed to his optimism by ensuring that his business has the funding headroom it needs to plan ahead. There is nothing better than seeing a client rebuild and go from strength to strength as the hospitality sector returns to normal.”</p>]]></content>

I am confident that Time Finance are in a great position to lead the sector in doing so. We have exciting plans to further develop our business as a multi-product independent SME funder helping businesses to recover and grow and I look forward to leading the business through the next stage of its journey.”</p>

<p>As the market continues to improve, Time Finance are confident that under Ed’s leadership the business is well-positioned to take advantage of the opportunities that should arise over the coming months and beyond.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>As John Newman, Chairman of Time Finance commented:&nbsp;</strong>"We are delighted to have secured Ed’s talents on a permanent basis. He is a well-respected and proven Chief Executive with an exceptional record and was a natural choice for the Group. Not only does he bring enormous depth of experience of the wider Financial Services market from his time with Bibby, but he also has an in-depth understanding and grasp of the Group from his time as its COO. We are excited about the vision and leadership that he will bring to the business and for the future of the Group”.</p>

		<slug><![CDATA[investment-is-top-of-the-agenda-for-uk-businesses]]></slug>

		<updated><![CDATA[2021-06-15 08:37:13]]></updated>
		<content><![CDATA[<p>Now is a good time to invest in business according to the latest survey by alternative finance provider,<a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&nbsp;Time Finance</a>. &nbsp;The survey found that 100% of businesses and financial intermediaries agreed that investing in business to recover and move forward should be happening now.</p>

<p>The survey also found that businesses were intending to focus investment across all aspects of their business over the next 12 months. An incredible 78% of respondents cited investment in new equipment, followed by new products and services (45%), improved products and services (39%), operational and technological advancements (34%), and marketing (28%). An additional 4 in 10 said they are currently embarking on a recruitment drive to bring fresh talent into their firms.</p>

<p>The findings come as industry figures reveal asset financing is on the rise. March statistics from the Financial Leasing Association (FLA) saw the asset finance market report its highest monthly new business total since June 2019 as businesses look to invest in the vital equipment in a bid to emerge from the pandemic stronger.</p>

<p>Ed Rimmer, CEO at Time Finance, comments: “The easing of lockdown restrictions and rollout of the covid-19 vaccine has no doubt injected a boost of optimism in businesses across the country. We know too well that the businesses who set themselves apart from the competition by innovating and investing will thrive in this time, and so it’s great to see the market reporting this rise in activity too. Access to finance is key to making this happen.”</p>

<p><a href="https://timefinance.com/clients/time-finance-boost-brush-baby-business">Brush Baby&nbsp;</a>is one business who, after securing funding from Time Finance during the pandemic, is set to put investment and innovation at the top of their agenda and expand its product range. In 2007, Dominique Tillen, founder of Brush Baby, saw a gap in the market to empower parents to look after their children’s dental health and make toothbrushing time fun. As a mother looking to tackle her own daughter’s teething troubles, she designed and developed a chewable toothbrush. From that success, an internationally selling and award-winning business was born.</p>

<p>When the pandemic enforced lockdowns across the world, the business faced disruption in their manufacturing operations based in China, with further impact on sales from the closure of shopping outlets and high-street stores. With adaptation and innovation second nature to Dominique, she remained determined to get her popular products back into parents reach. She turned to Time Finance for support and secured a £125,000 CBILS Loan.</p>

<p>Dominique, Founder and Managing Director of Brush-Baby, said: “Despite the challenges we’ve faced in the last 12 months, we want to continue innovating and growing our business where possible. Securing a CBILS loan has been critical in getting our business back on track and supporting the launch of our first re-chargeable range of electric toothbrushes. It’s an exciting time for us and we really believe our new ‘WildOnes’ range will be a popular hit amongst our growing customer bases.”</p>

<p>Now in a stronger position than before, Brush Baby are well on their way to recovery and can look to rebuild by manufacturing and expanding their product range.</p>

<p>Rimmer, adds: “We welcome growth and investment and are keen to support the UK businesses bounce back to pre-covid levels in the best way we can. The team at Time Finance are determined to support our clients and help them to receive the funding support they need to make key investments, remain competitive and grow with confidence.”</p>

		<content><![CDATA[<p>Now is a good time to invest in business according to the latest survey by alternative finance provider,<a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&nbsp;Time Finance</a>. &nbsp;The survey found that 100% of businesses and financial intermediaries agreed that investing in business to recover and move forward should be happening now.</p>

<p>The survey also found that businesses were intending to focus investment across all aspects of their business over the next 12 months. An incredible 78% of respondents cited investment in new equipment, followed by new products and services (45%), improved products and services (39%), operational and technological advancements (34%), and marketing (28%). An additional 4 in 10 said they are currently embarking on a recruitment drive to bring fresh talent into their firms.</p>

<p>The findings come as industry figures reveal asset financing is on the rise. March statistics from the Financial Leasing Association (FLA) saw the asset finance market report its highest monthly new business total since June 2019 as businesses look to invest in the vital equipment in a bid to emerge from the pandemic stronger.</p>

<p>Ed Rimmer, CEO at Time Finance, comments: “The easing of lockdown restrictions and rollout of the covid-19 vaccine has no doubt injected a boost of optimism in businesses across the country. We know too well that the businesses who set themselves apart from the competition by innovating and investing will thrive in this time, and so it’s great to see the market reporting this rise in activity too. Access to finance is key to making this happen.”</p>

<p><a href="https://timefinance.com/clients/time-finance-boost-brush-baby-business">Brush Baby&nbsp;</a>is one business who, after securing funding from Time Finance during the pandemic, is set to put investment and innovation at the top of their agenda and expand its product range. In 2007, Dominique Tillen, founder of Brush Baby, saw a gap in the market to empower parents to look after their children’s dental health and make toothbrushing time fun. As a mother looking to tackle her own daughter’s teething troubles, she designed and developed a chewable toothbrush. From that success, an internationally selling and award-winning business was born.</p>

<p>When the pandemic enforced lockdowns across the world, the business faced disruption in their manufacturing operations based in China, with further impact on sales from the closure of shopping outlets and high-street stores. With adaptation and innovation second nature to Dominique, she remained determined to get her popular products back into parents reach. She turned to Time Finance for support and secured a £125,000 CBILS Loan.</p>

		<content><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time Finance&nbsp;</a>has become an accredited lender under the Government’s <a href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/rls">Recovery Loan Scheme</a> (RLS) via the British Business Bank. Under the Scheme, Time Finance will be able to support UK SME’s looking for additional funding through the provision of <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/loans" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">loans</a> and <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/asset-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">asset finance</a> up to £150,000 with terms available of up to six years.</p>

<p>The Recovery Loan Scheme supports access to finance for UK businesses as they recover and grow following the pandemic. Under the Scheme, businesses who have been negatively affected by COVID-19 can borrow funds for a wide variety of purposes – whether that be to support cashflow or to fund new investments. It is open to all businesses irrespective of turnover and businesses that have taken out a CBILS, CLBILS or BBLS facility are able to access the new scheme, although the amount they have borrowed under a previous scheme may in certain circumstances limit the amount they may borrow under RLS. &nbsp;Time Finance will be working closely with a select panel of brokers to manage new business enquiries and help business owners access the funding support they so urgently need.</p>

<p>Time Finance was also an accredited lender under the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS) demonstrating the firms’ commitment to continuing their support for 20,000+ UK businesses as they build back from the pandemic.</p>

<p><strong>Ed Rimmer, CEO at Time Finance said:</strong> “A staple part of any recovery plan is securing finance for future growth and the Recovery Loan Scheme can help business owners do just that. We are thrilled that the British Business Bank has accredited us as a lender under the Scheme and this new offering will complement our existing portfolio of funding solutions which includes – Asset Finance, Invoice Finance, Loans and Vehicle Finance.</p>

<p>“Throughout the pandemic, our teams have remained committed to delivering finance solutions that inspire confidence and growth. We’re proud to have this accreditation under our belt and look forward to continuing to help more businesses access the cash they so urgently need.”</p>

<p>Over the course of the last 12 months, Time Finance has been helping impacted customers by providing tailored support on a case-by-case basis, including restructuring payments, providing forbearance and packaging additional headroom facilities. They also developed and launched ‘Low Start’ to help SMEs manage the cost of investments and to finance vital equipment. The initiative helps business owners to obtain a lower starting option on their lease, making significantly smaller payments at the beginning of their agreement, for either three or six months.</p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time Finance</a> have supported family-owned business, Vertical Rigging, drive their growth strategy forward with a Vehicle Finance funding solution leaving the firms cashflow unaffected and available to use to bring their plans to life.</p>

<p>Vertical Rigging specialise in the provision of safety management and rope access services to the renewable energy and construction sectors. Recognised alongside their client base as an essential service throughout the pandemic, husband-and-wife duo Riccardo and Nicola Roberts, worked hard to scale up their services over the last 12 months to take on new business opportunities with confidence.</p>

<p>2021 has seen the business embark on an investment drive which has included a rebrand and the launch of a new website, as they seek to promote their specialist services and acquire new customers as part of their growth plans. &nbsp;Conducting site visits for new and existing clients is a critical part of the sales and customer service processes and as they look to scale up their services, they needed to purchase a new vehicle to enable them to keep their business on the road. &nbsp;Funding the purchase of a new vehicle or fleet of vehicles, however, can use up valuable working capital, so Vertical Rigging turned to Time Finance for support. As one of the UK’s leading <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/vehicle-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vehicle Finance</a> brokers, Time Finance could help the client source a funding solution to help them purchase the vehicle of their choice and spread the cost over an agreed period of time into manageable and affordable payments.</p>

<p><strong>Riccardo Roberts, Managing Director at Vertical Rigging, said:</strong> “Despite the challenges the last 12 months have thrown at us, we wanted to continue innovating and growing our business where possible. Our investment drive has been critical in re-aligning our proposition to the market and securing those new business opportunities in the sectors we’re really passionate about working with. It’s an exciting time for us. This additional new vehicle is a massive asset to the business and help our teams get out onto the road to support our expanding client base. We can’t thank Time Finance enough; their finance solution means that our cashflow remains unaffected and we can continue to push ahead with other initiatives knowing we have the funds to make them happen.”</p>

<p><strong>Alun Winter, Head of Broking at Time Finance, added:</strong> “It was a pleasure to support Riccardo and Nicola. When investment is high on the agenda, funding is key to keep valuable working capital in the business. Vehicle Finance was an ideal solution for this business, allowing them to manage the cost of this investment over time. We wish the best of luck to the whole team at Vertical Rigging and look forward to continuing to support them as they take their business to new heights.”</p>

<p>As well as Vehicle Finance, Time Finance specialise in the provision or arrangement of <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/asset-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Asset Finance</a>, <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Invoice Finance</a> and <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/loans" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Loans</a>.

		<content><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time Finance</a> have announced that Rebekah Middleton has taken up a new role within the firm as <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/asset-finance">Head of Hard and Soft Asset</a> and Direct Business. Rebekah previously held the role of Head of Hard Asset and the move sees her take on additional responsibility to oversee their Asset offering with both their broker networks and through direct channels. Her focus will be on enabling UK businesses to access the funding solutions they require to invest in the vital equipment their firms need to achieve their plans.</p>

<p>Rebekah brings over 20 years industry experience to the role having built a credible career working in sales management and business development roles across the financial services sector, most notably for Bibby Financial Services and Davenham <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/asset-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Asset Finance.</a> Equipped with a wealth of experience in building and maintaining strong relationships with brokers and supporting their clients with innovative and creative asset-based funding solutions she will bring that experience in driving new business from both broker-introduced and direct opportunities.</p>

<p><strong>Speaking of the appointment, Rebekah said:&nbsp;</strong>“I am delighted to step up to this role at such a pivotal time for UK businesses. The last year has seen SMEs continue to invest in larger assets as they continued to trade but for those firms affected by lockdown restrictions it has been challenging. As the UK moves out of all restrictions in a few weeks time, businesses who start investing again will benefit from the growing momentum to getting back to business. Our <a href="https://timefinance.com/press-releases/investment-is-top-of-the-agenda-for-uk-businesses">recent survey</a> found that 100% of UK business owners and intermediaries think now is the time to invest with 78% stating they intend to invest in new equipment over the next 12 months.</p>

<p>Our Asset Finance solutions continue to be a valuable and staple finance solution for <a href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/equipment-leasing">those who rely on new equipment</a> to make business happen and grow. I look forward to driving our solutions forward into the market and ultimately helping more business owners bring their plans to life.”</p>

<p>Time Finance’s Asset Finance solutions can help business owners to access the vital business equipment they need to take their business to the next level. By spreading the cost of investment into manageable, monthly payments, accessing new equipment becomes affordable and in turn helps generate new lines of revenue.</p>

<p><strong>Carol Roberts, Director of Asset Finance at Time Finance, commented:</strong> “I’m delighted to see Rebekah drive our soft and hard asset offerings forward into the market. With her proven track record of building long-lasting relationships with brokers and delivering creative funding solutions for their clients, I’m confident that her knowledge and expertise of the asset finance market will prove invaluable.”</p>

<p>The news following the recent announcement that <a href="https://timefinance.com/press-releases/time-finance-appoints-joe-ralphs-to-head-of-operations-role">Joe Ralphs will move to a Head of Operations role&nbsp;</a>at Time Finance, reflects the firm’s growing commitment to delivering a strong Asset Finance solution to brokers and their clients.</p>

<p>Time Finance also specialise in the provision or <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance">arrangement of Invoice Finance</a>, Loan and Vehicle Finance solutions. Since the beginning of the pandemic, Time Finance has been committed to working hard to help their customers through this turbulent period.

<p><strong>Rebekah further adds:&nbsp;</strong>“I will be looking to greatly improve income opportunities for our introducer partners by way of developing far more effective unified relationships and delivering our multi-product proposition.”</p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time Finance</a> have launched a new offering to business owners looking to source vehicles to help drive their business forward. Dedicated to helping firms source the right funding solution for their chosen vehicle, they have continued their investment in their <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/vehicle-finance">new site</a> to provide customers with upfront information at the touch of a button.</p>

<p>The launch comes at an opportune time for business owners with investment high on the agenda. A recent survey conducted by Time Finance found that 100% of business owners plan to make key investments over the next 12 months to support their business growth.</p>

<p>With SMEs keen to get back into the driving seat on their road to recovery, commercial vehicle production is getting itself back into gear for a rise in activity. The latest figures from SMMT reveal that vehicle manufacturing was up 2.2% on pre-pandemic levels, with 6.243 new units rolling off the production lines in May.</p>

<p>The latest <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/vehicle-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vehicle Finance</a> development featured on timefinance.com allows users to search for a vehicle of their choice and view the funding options available. The site will also reveal a selection of special offers that are available on specific models. Working with their panel of funders, Time Finance can present some of the best deals on the market. Catering for any budget size, business owners can look to affordably invest in new vehicles and fleets through the Time Finance website.</p>

<p><strong>Alun Winter, Director of Broking at Time Finance, said:</strong> “With investment clearly at the forefront of SME’s minds, firms may be looking to purchase a new company vehicle or update part of their fleet. We wanted to help our customers get the information they need to make decisions quickly and so we have invested in providing them with the best rates on the market for every make and model of vehicle so they can easily find what they are looking for. For both existing and new clients, the enhancements have been designed to get their businesses back on the road and ready to capitalise on the increasing opportunities.”</p>

<p>Vehicle Finance continues to be a valuable and staple finance solution for businesses who rely on one-off vehicles or fleets to make business happen. Through their vehicle and <a href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/fleet-solutions" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fleet solutions</a>, Time Finance work closely with businesses of all sizes to source the vehicle they need and present the deal that best suits them, whether that’s affordability, term length, mileage, type of vehicle, additional features and much more.

		<slug><![CDATA[scorpion-es-to-spark-growth-with-funding-solution-from-time-finance]]></slug>
		<published><![CDATA[2021-07-27 09:00:00]]></published>
		<updated><![CDATA[2021-07-27 09:00:00]]></updated>
		<content><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time Finance</a> are delighted to announce they have supported a mechanical and electrical engineering firm, Scorpion ES, with a £200,000 <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Invoice Finance</a> facility to help spark future growth plans.</p>

<p>Incorporated in 2010, Scorpion ES set out to provide mechanical and electrical services to the construction sector. As the business evolved over time, it achieved exponential growth and moved into other areas of work including rail infrastructure, facilities maintenance and civil construction services. Having invested in a new management team to drive its continued growth strategy forward, the business went from strength to strength, and secured large contracts with Tier 1 National Rail companies.</p>

<p>Like many businesses, however, Scorpion found themselves held back by the pandemic. The enforced social distancing restrictions meant that the number of workers attending each site was limited and as a result, projects experienced significant delays. Richard Clatworthy, Managing Director at Scorpion ES, recognised that access to funding during this time was essential to maintain cashflow to support operational expenses and turned to their financial advisor, Cornerstone Commercial Finance for advice. Having understood their situation, Cornerstone Commercial Finance recommended Time Finance.</p>

<p><strong>Janice Quick, Business Development Manager at Time Finance, said:</strong> “We have seen so many businesses affected by the challenges of the last year and we have remained committed throughout that time to supporting businesses to get them through and back on track. It’s been a pleasure to support Richard and the team. We took the time to understand the business and tailor a funding facility that would tackle the immediate cashflow issues caused by the pandemic but be flexible enough to match their future growth ambitions moving forward.”</p>

<p><strong>Richard Clatworthy comments:&nbsp;</strong>“Determined to come out of the pandemic stronger, we set out on a large-scale investment drive to bring new talent into our firm and to take on new contracts with confidence. The funding solution from Time Finance has been instrumental in helping us to bring these goals to life.

		<content><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time Finance</a> are pleased to announce that they have appointed Samantha Leith as Business Development Manager in their <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance">Invoice Finance</a> division.</p>

<p>Samantha joins with over 10 years’ experience, having gained valuable experience in a variety of client management roles before moving into sales. Samantha started her career as a credit controller at Bibby Financial Services, before moving on to become a Relationship Manager at Aldermore and managing a broad portfolio of clients. Most recently, she secured a role in business development with Siemens, supporting UK SME owners access the finance solutions they need to achieve their growth plans. With a proven track record behind her, Samantha joins the Time Finance team and takes on responsibility for building and maintaining strong introducer relations whilst expanding their Invoice Finance offering in the East Midlands and surrounding areas.</p>

<p><strong>Speaking of her appointment, Samantha said:&nbsp;</strong>“I am absolutely delighted to be joining Time Finance at what continues to be a crucially important time for SMEs. The economy was hit hard by the pandemic, and with small businesses at the backbone of that, it’s vital that we help as many firms as possible access the funding support they need to recover, innovate and grow. I’ll be using my experience to continue building strong intermediary relationships and packaging flexible Invoice Finance facilities.”</p>

<p>Time Finance’s recent survey revealed that 40% of SMEs are looking to bring fresh talent into their business and their own Invoice Finance division is no different. Samantha’s appointment follows a number of other announcements over the past 2 months, including Ed Rimmer’s appointment as permanent CEO, Simon Holian and Rob Walters as Business Development Managers, and Adam Shakespear who joined as a Business Development Executive. All of this confirms the firm’s commitment to investing in their people as well as driving growth and awareness across their multi-product portfolio of financial solutions.</p>

<p><strong>Phil Chesham, Head of Invoice Finance at Time Finance, commented:</strong> “It’s a pleasure to welcome Samantha to our growing team. It comes at an opportune time where demand for finance is high - with a national sales presence we can react to opportunities swiftly and ensure businesses get the funding solutions they need to grow and thrive. We’re positive Samantha will be a great addition.”</p>

<p>Invoice Finance can relieve pressure on cashflow and give businesses the freedom to grow. By releasing up to 90% of the value of unpaid invoices, business owners can access additional working capital and use the funds to support day-to-day cashflow requirements or support innovation and growth. Time Finance offer confidential and disclosed facilities ranging from £10,000 to £2.5million, with the added flexibility that their facilities can grow alongside a business.</p>

<p>Time Finance <a name="_Hlk62551470">also specialise in the provision or arrangement of&nbsp;</a><a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/asset-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Asset Finance</a>, <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/loans" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Loan</a> and <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/vehicle-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vehicle Finance</a> solutions. Since the beginning of the pandemic, Time Finance has been working hard to help its customers through this turbulent period with their portfolio of solutions. The CBILS accreditation that they received back in May 2020 and their latest RLS accreditation provides an additional opportunity to instil reassurance and confidence back into British business through Asset Finance and Loan facilities.</p>

		<content><![CDATA[<p align="center"><em>With new data from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) showing that the UK economy grew by 4.8% in the second quarter of 2021, there are some really promising signs that our economic recovery is gathering pace. It’s a pivotal time for businesses; there’s a strong sense of optimism enjoyed across the board but this must be harnessed if we’re to maintain momentum.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p align="center"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/carol-roberts-806aa8/"><em>Carol Roberts</em></a><em>, Director of Asset Finance, explores the vital role that Asset Finance is playing in our continued recovery.</em></p>

<p>“Despite the fact that the Government’s pandemic support packages are drawing to a close, we have seen some very clear indicators of optimism across our entire business over the past few months and it is encouraging to see that this trend is now evident in the ONS’ most recent data on economic growth. Our economy having grown 4.8% between April and June is a mark of commercial resilience, of businesses’ abilities to adapt, diversify and find ways to sustain and grow against the odds. This news will be a welcome sigh of relief for many, but we can’t rest on our laurels; we must continue to look forward.</p>

<p>“A good business leader will keep a constant eye on opportunity. In our <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/asset-finance">Asset Finance</a> business, we have seen this for ourselves over the course of 2021; <a href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/equipment-leasing">businesses have continued to come to us to facilitate investments in new equipment</a> that have enabled both growth in key sectors or opened businesses up to completely new markets. To me, that doesn’t suggest uncertainty. It demonstrates that UK business leaders are resolute in their plans to move forward and we can now see that this determination has paid off.</p>

<p>“One thing has definitely come out of the past 18 months and that is increasingly competitive markets. We have seen some really interesting trends amongst our Asset Finance clients as they seek to boost their offering to give them a more competitive edge. Whether this has been in new equipment in hospitality in response to changes in consumer habits or major investments in construction machinery to enhance a sector that has robustly weathered the past year, businesses have been unafraid to make investments to elevate themselves above their competitors.</p>

<p>“Of course, investments need to be right for the business and many business owners simply don’t have the capital to invest in growth; despite the optimism we are seeing, there is no denying that revenues were down for a time and as a result there hasn’t been a wealth of available cash to invest in assets. This is where <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/asset-finance">Asset Finance</a> is extremely valuable to our clients; it allows investments to be made into the business without losing a huge chunk of capital. Our clients also have the option to refinance existing equipment to release capital back into the business, thereby enabling additional investments to facilitate growth.</p>

<p>“It is going to be really interesting to see where our economic recovery goes from here. The economy is still 4.4% below the pre-pandemic levels in 2019 but we have proven that we are a robust nation. I am very excited about the role that Asset Finance has to play in our continued growth and to see new trends in business investments as we continue to look to the future.”</p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<p align="center"><em>One month since the Government’s reforms to the Prompt Payment Code came into force, Phil Chesham, Head of Invoice Finance at Time Finance, shares his insight on the challenges facing SMEs across the UK due to late payment.</em></p>

<p>“In January this year, the Government announced reforms to its Prompt Payment Code (PPC), with signatories pledging to pay invoices from small businesses within 30 days (previously 60), and in theory this was welcome news in what has been a very challenging year for most. The PPC reforms, designed to clamp down on poor payment practices, came into force on the 1st July and with over 3,200 signatories, one would hope that these measures would be the much-needed lifeline that small businesses need to help manage their cash-flow.</p>

<p>“There are, however, some sobering figures that demonstrate the true scale of the issue of late payment and the impact that this can have on businesses. When the Government announced the reforms in January, it was accompanied by the shocking statistic that £23.4bn of late invoices are owed to UK businesses. Recent data from Quickbooks* also showed that each SME in the UK is currently owed an average of £21,000 in late payments, and according to the Federation of Small Businesses, around 50,000 businesses close every year due to late payments.</p>

<p>“So the challenge here is vast, and the worry for many businesses is that the reforms to the PPC simply won’t go far enough to address the issue. For one thing, becoming a signatory to the PPC is completely voluntary. It is a commendable best practice network but it isn’t enforceable and for this reason, businesses cannot depend on it as the sole solution to the enormous issue of late payment.</p>

<p>“Businesses are increasingly looking elsewhere for a solution to this issue. The revenue tied up in unpaid invoices is cash that could be spent on growth and businesses need a means of accessing that capital rather than waiting sometimes up to three months to be paid. <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance">Invoice Finance</a> is a valuable solution that can relieve pressure on cash-flow and, crucially, give businesses the means to grow. By releasing up to 90% of the value of unpaid invoices, business owners can access additional working capital and use the funds to support day-to-day cash-flow requirements or support innovation and growth. This can really help when planning for critical months, but it can also enable businesses to invest in resource, improved technology or marketing. With Invoice Finance, the amount of funding increases as the business’ turnover grows - in essence it can become a core part of a business’ expansion model.</p>

<p>“Of course, any effort to tackle late payment is welcome news to UK businesses and further reforms to the PPC will undoubtedly come with time. But as we all navigate our way through the post-pandemic recovery, alternative finance has a very important role to play, not just in the survival of businesses, but also in unlocking their growth potential.”</p>

		<title><![CDATA[A day in the life of Time Finance CEO Ed Rimmer]]></title>
		<slug><![CDATA[a-day-in-the-life-of-time-finance-ceo-ed-rimmer]]></slug>
		<published><![CDATA[2021-09-01 15:38:46]]></published>
		<updated><![CDATA[2021-09-01 15:38:46]]></updated>
		<content><![CDATA[<p><strong>As a leader, you are responsible for the overall success of a business and are there to lead and inspire your team to achieve a set of business goals. Business environments change quickly, so CEOs are required to react swiftly, adapt to change and make top-level decisions to drive success. But how do these business leaders go about their daily routine? Ed Rimmer shares what a day in the life of a CEO at Time Finance looks like in his latest interview with&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.businessleader.co.uk/my-working-day-ed-rimmer-ceo-of-time-finance/130436/"><strong>Business Leader</strong></a><strong>.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>What time do you usually wake up?</strong></p>

<p>I’m an early riser at 6:30am to get a kick-start on the day. Leadership requires your a-game, so I like to get up bright and early to be well prepared for the start of the working day.</p>

<p><strong>What do you typically have for breakfast?</strong></p>

<p>Cereal and orange juice</p>

<p><strong>What’s the rest of your morning routine before you start work?</strong></p>

<p>I keep my mornings as active as possible and often go for a scenic run around Chester to clear my mind. Gearing up for the working day, I’ll also catch up on the latest news – the FT and BBC are my go-to for what’s happening in the business finance market. This is a really important part of my day as it gives me a heads up on issues that affect our clients. Many of the businesses we work with are SMEs and a lot has happened over the past year that impacts them, so keeping abreast of the latest news or government legislation is vital to ensure we give them the support that they need.</p>

<p><strong>First thing you do at the start of a workday?</strong></p>

<p>My first priority is checking in with the team to talk through any arising matters. I find that doing this over the phone, rather than email, is much more effective and gives us the opportunity to talk things through in more detail. This also helps to motivate and set a positive tone for a productive working day. I’ll check my emails to see if anything urgent has come through; I always allow time in my diary for the unexpected so I can respond to anything that needs immediate attention.</p>

<p><strong>How do you prioritise your work?</strong></p>

<p>My working style is quite efficient and I’m sure to make the most of every available hour in the day but the nature of our business does require flexibility too. Our clients’ needs are ever-changing and one of our greatest strengths is our commitment to responding to those needs quickly, so I’m keen to avoid working too rigidly. This is especially true at the moment as the government support schemes begin to wind down and more businesses are turning to alternative finance for their long-term investment strategies.</p>

<p>But I’m also a stickler for being organised, which helps keep me flexible and agile. Each night, I read through my calendar (electronic as well as old-school paper diary) and plan my to-do list to prepare for up-coming meetings and calls and key deliverables for the week.</p>

<p>I think in life, prioritising is a challenge that everyone faces and we can get so caught up with the things that require our urgent attention that we’re at risk of forgetting matters that may not be urgent but are still important. I consider my own professional development here. Learning is a constant process; the world is always changing and to maintain a competitive edge, leaders must keep an open mind and keep learning. This is a huge focus for me, which I am keen to fit around my day-to-day priorities.</p>

<p><strong>Do you plan meetings or are they a waste of time?</strong></p>

<p>Meetings are rarely a waste of time. They form a big part of how we establish our culture and how we deliver our service. We work in finance but we are a people-based business and whether it is with the team or with clients, meetings are the only way you can truly get to know someone and understand what matters to them.</p>

<p>Meetings are also important to ensure we create a working culture that is productive, professional but also fun. Leaders have had to guide their teams through a lot of change over the past year and Time Finance is no exception. I value meetings as a way of touching base with the team, clients and stakeholders and I am pleased that these will soon once again be in person.</p>

<p>In a post-pandemic world, I’d like to visit all of our offices and meet the teams face-to-face. Every member of our team is important to our business and there’s no replacement for meeting in person, understanding their role within the business, making sure they know that they’re valued, all of which helps motivate them to succeed.</p>

<p><strong>Do you have a working lunch or is it good to take a break?</strong></p>

<p>I used to work through my lunch every day, but as I’ve become more established in my career I’ve seen first-hand the benefits of taking a break and giving myself time to reset, and this is something I actively encourage amongst the team. Now, you’ll find me taking my lunch breaks outside to get some fresh air and, since we’ve been spending more time at home, I get to spend that time with my family.</p>

<p><strong>When does your working day finish?</strong></p>

<p>I like to shut my computer down at around 6pm so that I can spend time with my family. If the past 18 months have taught us anything, it’s how valuable this time is. That said, as a CEO I make sure that I’m always contactable and available if anything urgent arises.</p>

<p><strong>How do you prepare for your next day’s work?</strong></p>

<p>Knowing what’s in the diary and where I need to be at what time helps me stay well-prepared for every day. Each evening before bed, I’ll spend an hour planning my day ahead and ensuring any urgent emails or calls have been responded to. This helps me to end the day feeling a sense of accomplishment and knowing I’m in a good place for the following day.</p>

<p><strong>What’s your favourite piece of technology?</strong></p>

<p>That’s easy – my iPhone. I use it for everything from reading the news, to sending emails and joining conference calls. We would have been lost without this technology over the past 18 months; it’s enabled us to continue an uninterrupted service to our clients when they’ve needed us most.</p>

<p><strong>How do you switch off?</strong></p>

<p>At <a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time Finance</a>, having a work-life balance is a key part of our working culture and for me personally this means keeping active. I find fresh air does the world of good, so I’ll often escape to the outdoors to switch off. My family and I enjoy regular trips to the Lake District and Wales for long walks in the breath-taking scenery. I’m a big sports fan so when I’m not playing, I’m volunteering to help at my children’s under 11 cricket and football games.</p>

<p><strong>Best piece of advice you’ve ever received?</strong></p>

<p>‘If you work hard you’ll get your just rewards’. I heard this from two very inspirational people in my life – my dad and my first boss. It’s something that’s always stuck with me. I believe you lead by example – I learned the value of hard work growing up and throughout my career and having a strong work ethic is something I am keen to encourage in those around me.</p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time Finance</a> are delighted to announce that they have secured Adrian Payne as Head of Sales in their <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance">Invoice Finance</a> division. The appointment is reflective of the firm’s ambitious growth plans to expand their national sales presence and help more businesses access the funding solutions they need to grow and prosper.</p>

<p>In his new role, Adrian will be responsible for leading and managing the sales team in the South of England as they continue to work with their extensive broker networks and package uniquely structured Invoice Finance solutions for their growing client base.</p>

<p>Adrian brings a wealth of experience and a credible reputation to the role having worked in the sector for almost a decade. Starting his career as a Business Development Manager, Adrian sought to build a strong broker network of his own and support UK SME owners access the finance they need to achieve their growth plans. As a high performer, he progressed quickly and worked his way up the ranks to become a Regional Sales Manager at Aldermore before moving on to become a Regional Director at Ultimate Finance. In his most recent role as Head of Sales for Bibby Financial Services he was responsible for generating awareness of their product offerings across the South West of England and managing a sales team of 6.</p>

<p><strong>Speaking of his appointment, Adrian comments:&nbsp;</strong>"It’s an exciting time to be joining Time Finance. There’s a definite momentum in the market with investment high on the agenda and many business owners are looking for cashflow funding solutions to help capitalise on new business opportunities.</p>

<p>“I’m looking forward to leading a dynamic and committed team who have already built an excellent reputation for delivering creative funding solutions that inspire the confidence business owners need to take their businesses to the next level. Over the years, I have watched Time Finance grow from strength to strength, and now with a robust multi-product offering in place, I believe they are well-placed to help fuel this growth.”</p>

<p><strong>Phil Chesham, Head of Invoice Finance at Time Finance, added:</strong> "We are delighted to welcome Adrian to Time Finance as we continue to expand our team and bring great talent into the business. He will undoubtably be a great addition given his proven track record of delivering new business targets and leading regional sales teams to success.</p>

<p>“Invoice Finance continues to be a valuable and staple finance solution for businesses who are looking to release additional working capital to fund innovation and growth. We have ambitious growth objectives to continue enabling UK firms to do just that and Adrian’s appointment will help us in achieving this.”</p>

<p>Time Finance also specialise in the provision or arrangement of <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/asset-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Asset Finance</a>, <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/loans" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Loan </a>and <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/vehicle-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vehicle Finance</a> solutions. Since the beginning of the pandemic, Time Finance has been working hard to help its customers through this turbulent period with their portfolio of solutions. The CBILS accreditation that they received back in May 2020 and their latest RLS accreditation provides an additional opportunity to instil reassurance and confidence back into British business through Asset Finance and Loan facilities.</p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<p align="center"><strong><em>Businesses urged to keep their eye on the ball as the market reports business confidence hits four-year high&nbsp;</em></strong></p>

<p>AIM-listed alternative finance provider,<a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&nbsp;Time Finance</a>, is gearing up for a rise in demand for alternative finance solutions as business confidence continues to grow and the UK’s pandemic recovery gathers pace.</p>

<p>The move is accompanied by a caution from Time Finance that the business community will require careful financial planning as the Government pandemic support begins to wind down, adding cashflow challenges that could hamper economic recovery.</p>

<p>Ed Rimmer, Chief Executive Officer at Time Finance, commented: “The ONS recently reported that the economy grew by an unexpected 4.8% in the second quarter of 2021. We’re further along the road to recovery than we expected to be and with data from Lloyds Banking Group showing that business confidence is at its highest level since 2017, there is certainly cause for optimism. This is something we are seeing amongst our customers, many of which are making headway with their investment plans. Confidence has returned but this optimism should be accompanied by some necessary caution.</p>

<p>“We are approaching the end of the Government’s Furlough scheme, which means firms will now recommence paying salaries, which will have a substantial impact if their income hasn’t returned to pre-pandemic levels. Many businesses have benefited from the likes of Bounce Back Loans, the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Schemes, HMRC deferments and Business Rates Relief. They need to have a plan in place to ensure these returning overheads are covered and this will introduce new pressures on cashflow. At Time Finance we are working with many of our customers to support their needs as they map their financial strategies. We’re certainly seeing optimism amongst businesses, but we also need to be realistic; businesses will still need financial support to avoid the risk of insolvency.”</p>

<p>Investment at Time Finance has seen the business bolster a variety of financial solutions to cater to growing demand. So far this year the business has made a series of key appointments as well as restructuring its management teams while investing in new technology to meet demand and support the fast delivery of multiple funding solutions for businesses.</p>

<p>The business has doubled its Northern sales team as well as expanding its Invoice Finance team, restructuring its Asset Finance division and launching its new Vehicle Finance offering in response to a rise in commercial vehicle activity.</p>

<p>Ed continued: “Not only are we investing in our services, but we are also constantly reviewing the business landscape to understand the challenges, or indeed opportunities, our clients experience to ensure we provide them with the right support. Our investment in our Vehicle Finance offering as well as our Asset Finance and Invoice Finance divisions will ensure that we can service our customers in these high demand areas, providing them with a multi-service solution to cater to their varying needs.</p>

<p>“While these changes form part of our own growth strategy, they also give some insight into the short to medium-term picture for our economic recovery. Aside from the Lloyds’ recent data, I believe that the current confidence amongst businesses is somewhat underreported; in May this year, Time Finance’s survey found that two thirds of businesses were optimistic about the future with 100% of business owners planning to make key investments over the next 12 months. To me, that gives a clear indication of the optimism felt despite the Government’s covid-relief coming to an end, and harnessing this optimism will be the key to maintaining momentum in our economic recovery.”</p>

		<content><![CDATA[<p align="center"><em>80% of UK businesses turning to the accessibility and flexibility of alternative finance to fund key investments</em></p>

<p>New data from AIM-listed alternative finance provider, <a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time Finance</a>, has shown that alternative finance is ranked the highest amongst funding solutions as businesses seek investment in future growth as the Government’s pandemic support draws to a close.</p>

<p>Time Finance’s latest survey showed that 80% of businesses plan to use alternative finance through a financial intermediary to make key investments, climbing from 44% in the business’ previous survey in July 2021.</p>

<p>Ed Rimmer, Chief Executive Officer at Time Finance, commented: “Our most recent survey has confirmed what we have predicted for some time now; investment for growth is very much at the forefront for UK businesses and they are seeking reliable, trustworthy and accessible lenders to which they can turn as the Government ends its various pandemic relief funding and support packages.”</p>

<p>Business respondents identified new personnel (35%) and new equipment (33%) as their top areas of investment. Financial intermediaries also stated 80% of their clients intend to use alternative finance to fund team and equipment investments. 92% said they would be making these investments in the next six months.</p>

<p>Ed continued: “In our July survey, we found that just 28% of intermediaries anticipated that their clients planned to invest in new personnel. Three months later this has climbed to 80%. That is a huge indicator of renewed business confidence and mirrors the recent reports from the Insolvency Service that August saw the lowest figure for proposed job cuts for seven years despite the imminent end to Furlough. From our survey we can see that investments in new personnel are an immediate priority for businesses and this gives us an important barometer not just for business confidence, but for increased employment opportunities as we emerge from the challenges of the pandemic.”</p>

<p>The latest survey from Time Finance paints a picture of optimism, echoing data from the Office of National Statistics (ONS)*, which in July reported 85% of businesses are confident of survival. This was further reported in August with Lloyds Banking Group reporting that business confidence is at its highest level since 2017.</p>

<p>Ed added: “It is extremely encouraging to see all signs pointing in the right direction; optimism is a true catalyst to growth and if harnessed in the right way, this will give a significant boost to our economic recovery. We at Time Finance know that we have an important role to play in unlocking businesses’ potential and we have spent many months preparing our business for the increased demand that is now materialising.”</p>

<p>The new survey data from Time Finance closely follows the <a href="https://timefinance.com/press-releases/time-finance-secure-sharon-bryden-as-director-of-commercial-loans-abl">appointment of Sharon Bryden</a> as Director of Commercial Loans and Asset Based Lending, the latest in a line of key appointments that has seen the business bolster its portfolio of funding solutions.</p>

<p>Sharon comments: “I have joined Time Finance at a critical time. UK businesses need robust and reliable finance but more than this they require this funding to offer diverse solutions. Time Finance is known for its varied portfolio of funding solutions, which can be accessed in tandem through our multi-product solution. Time Finance listens to its market and responds with investments in its team and its technology to aid the fast delivery of funding to businesses. Our recent survey shows that the demand is profound and we are more than ready to support those that need us.”</p>

		<content><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time Finance</a> are pleased to announce that they have appointed Dan Hindmarsh as Broker Manager in their Asset Finance division.</p>

<p>Dan joins with over 5 years’ industry experience, having started his career as a Customer Services Representative at Aldermore Bank and managing relationships with a broad portfolio of clients. He then moved into a business development role with Metro Bank, educating brokers on the benefits of <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/asset-finance">Asset Finance&nbsp;</a>solutions and helping their clients access flexible funding facilities to enable investment in key pieces of equipment. With a proven track record behind him, Dan steps up to the new position within Time Finance and takes on responsibility for building and maintaining strong broker relations whilst expanding their Asset Finance offering in the South East of England.</p>

<p><strong>Speaking of his appointment, Dan said:&nbsp;</strong>“It’s a really exciting time to be joining the Time Finance team, who have an excellent reputation within the business finance sector for their wide-ranging product portfolio, their responsiveness to brokers and clients’ needs, as well as their expert-led teams. I look forward to introducing Time Finance’s Asset Finance solutions to my brokers and their clients as investment remains top of the agenda and businesses continue to look for affordable solutions to help facilitate growth.”</p>

<p>The announcement follows a number of recent appointments and promotions within Time Finance, including <a href="https://timefinance.com/press-releases/time-finance-expand-asset-finance-team-with-abbie-mosley-appointment">Abbie Mosley to Broker Manager&nbsp;</a>in the North, <a href="https://timefinance.com/press-releases/rebekah-middleton-secures-head-of-hard-and-soft-asset-position">Rebekah Middleton to Head of Hard &amp; Soft Asset</a> and <a href="https://timefinance.com/press-releases/time-finance-appoints-joe-ralphs-to-head-of-operations-role">Joe Ralphs to Head of Operations</a>, further demonstrating the firm’s commitment to investing in their people as well as delivering a strong Asset Finance solution to UK SMEs.</p>

<p>“As a national sales team, we are committed to delivering valuable and staple finance solutions to businesses who are looking to invest in the vital pieces of equipment they need to achieve innovation and growth. We have ambitious plans to continue enabling UK SMEs to gain easy access to our Asset Finance solutions and Dan’s appointment will help us in achieving this.”</p>

		<content><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time Finance</a>, the AIM listed independent specialist finance provider to UK SMEs, is pleased to report a resilient performance in the financial year to 31 May 2021. The business has remained profitable throughout the course of the pandemic with their end of year performance recording a 3% increase in PBTE despite revenues dropping by 17%. The firm has reported that momentum in the first quarter of the current financial year is steadily increasing as UK businesses look to source longer term sources of finance to support their recovery.</p>

<p>Ed Rimmer, CEO at Time Finance, commented: “Market conditions remain challenging as the overhang of government funding initiatives is still apparent; however, it is likely that demand for finance will increase again through the course of our financial year as businesses navigate their own recovery and map out their financial strategies. Our response will be to deliver a diverse portfolio of funding solutions that are designed to support businesses with their growth plans.”</p>

<p>There have been many significant initiatives contributing to the delivery of another strong year. Among them the business rebranded in December last year simplifying the operating structure under a single nationally recognised brand offering an extensive portfolio of funding solutions. Their commitment to supporting more businesses during the pandemic saw the firm win approval to offer the CBILS and RLS to businesses strengthening their portfolio even further. And more recently they launched an online vehicle funding proposition to support firms looking to invest in new vehicles.</p>

<p>Time Finance also made a number of significant appointments recently including strengthening of the senior leadership team with Ed Rimmer as CEO, Tanya Raynes as Non-Executive Director and Sharon Bryden as Director of <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/loans" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Commercial Loans </a>&amp; <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/vehicle-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ABL</a>. The firm has also invested in expanding their national sales presence to support UK businesses access to funding which includes securing 7 new business development and broker managers within their <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/asset-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Asset Finance </a>and <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Invoice Finance</a> teams, as well as restructuring their Asset Finance proposition with a renewed focus on how to better serve their growing client base.</p>

<p>As Ed continues: “The last year has come with its challenges but it’s thanks to the resilience and hard work of our teams that we have continued to support our clients and their businesses throughout what has been a difficult time. Moving forward, we are pursuing a clearly defined growth strategy which will see Time Finance repositioned as a multi-product provider of funding solutions to UK businesses. We have strengthened our team and our diverse portfolio of funding solutions which makes us well-positioned to take advantage of the post-covid recovery.</p>

<p>“As the UK’s economic recovery gathers pace in our new financial year, we remain proactive and ready to take on the rise in demand for our alternative finance solutions and look forward to capitalising on these opportunities<em>.&nbsp;</em>We therefore look forward with a sense of cautious optimism”.</p>]]></content>

Both rates are significantly higher than the government minimum for over 23s, which currently stands at £8.91 per hour.</p>

<p>The AIM listed alternative finance provider currently employs over 160 employees over 6 UK sites. Its’ head office is situated in the South West, a region where over a fifth of all jobs (20%) pay less than the real Living Wage – around 456,000 jobs. Despite this, Time Finance pay all employees above this threshold and to further this commitment have been successfully approved as an accredited partner with the Living Wage.</p>

<p><strong>Holly Mapstone, Director of HR, at Time Finance said:</strong> “We want to be recognised as an ‘employer of choice’, treating everyone as we ourselves would like to be treated. A big part of our ethos is creating a culture whereby our staff feel they are treated fairly, with respect and gain our unwavering support. The creation of our ‘culture club’ was designed to do just that. Acting as a forum for the employee voice to capture sentiment, ideas for improvement and how to make Time Finance the ideal employer to work for. Now, with our commitment to the Living Wage also in place, we can lead by example and continue our mission to put our employees at the heart of everything we do.”</p>

<p>Time Finance regularly engage in new initiatives and projects to support their employees and create an inclusive and market-leading workplace. Their 2020 Talent Leadership Programme was formed to recognise excellence from within and enhance the skills of employees looking to become the “future leaders” of Time Finance.</p>

<p>In December 2020, Time Finance were named <a href="https://timefinance.com/press-releases/time-finance-named-employer-of-the-year">Employer of the Year</a> in the Business Leader Awards. The achievement recognises the employer who has created a stimulating and supportive work environment for their staff and has demonstrated a commitment to their welfare.</p>

<p><strong>Laura Gardiner, Director, Living Wage Foundation said:</strong> “We’re delighted that Time Finance has joined the movement of over 7,000 responsible employers across the UK who voluntarily commit to go further than the government minimum to make sure all their staff earn enough to live on.</p>

<p>“They join thousands of small businesses, as well as household names such as Burberry, Barclays, Everton Football Club and many more. These businesses recognise that paying the real Living Wage is the mark of a responsible employer and they, like Time Finance, believe that a hard day’s work deserves a fair day’s pay."</p>

<p>The real Living Wage is the only rate calculated according to the costs of living. It provides a voluntary benchmark for employers that wish to ensure their staff earn a wage they can live on, not just the government minimum. Since 2011 the Living Wage movement has delivered a pay rise to over 250,000 people and put over £1.3 billion extra into the pockets of low paid workers.</p>]]></content>

		<published><![CDATA[2021-10-06 07:34:17]]></published>
		<updated><![CDATA[2021-10-06 07:34:17]]></updated>
		<content><![CDATA[<p>In this month’s FLA Magazine, our very own Carol Roberts, Director of <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/asset-finance">Asset Finance</a> at <a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time Finance</a> and Board Director for both the FLA and The Leasing Foundation, shares her 50 years of industry experience in Asset Finance.</p>

<p><strong>1. Tell us about your career and the path into asset finance…</strong></p>

<p>I started my career in the world of finance over 50 years ago, taking my first steps into the sector at a young age as a finance clerk. I was thrust into a career which at that time was largely closed off to women, and so I grasped that opportunity with both hands. Thanks to hard work and determination, a lot of exciting opportunities to develop and progress came my way.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;"><em>I found that having someone notice something in you at a young age can make all the difference.</em></h4>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>That said, I owe much of my career development to the people who have believed in me and championed me over the years. I found that having someone notice something in you at a young age can make all the difference. It meant that I had the confidence to make a difference and step up to new roles with confidence and backing behind me. In fact, it’s one of the very reasons I’m such an advocate for mentorship now and actively participate in programmes to help young professionals advance in their careers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I’ve had the good fortune of working in a variety of roles over the years and working with some incredibly talented and hard-working individuals. With two colleagues I was able to set up the first leasing brokerage in the UK and ultimately sold that business to Pallas Group which was eventually sold to GE Capital where I become the Managing Director of the Asset Division, before moving on to a similar role at Bibby Financial Services. Now, as Director of Asset Finance at Time Finance, I lead our brilliant team to <a href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/equipment-leasing">deliver service excellence to a rapidly growing customer base looking to secure the vital equipment they need</a> to take their businesses to the next level.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>2. What’s been your career highlight so far?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>I’m lucky enough to say that I have had a number of career highlights I can look back on and be proud of.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I was the first female to win Leasing Life’s “Lifetime Achievement” award in 2017, as well as the first ever female to be Chair of Council at my golf club. I hope when I share these stories with other women, it shows them that anything really is possible.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;"><em>This gave me a platform to raise awareness on the importance of equality and diversion and to play a hands-on role in advocating change in the sector so that young people gain access to the opportunities they deserve.</em></h4>

<p style="text-align: center;">
	<br>
</p>

<p>That said, my main career highlight to date is my involvement as a board member of the Leasing Foundation. This gave me a platform to raise awareness on the importance of equality and diversion and to play a hands-on role in advocating change in the sector so that young people gain access to the opportunities they deserve.</p>

<p><strong>3. Asset finance is a pretty resilient sector, but what do you see as the big challenges this time around compared to the financial crisis of 2008?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/asset-finance">Asset Finance</a> sector and its client base has held strong fast and strong momentum during the pandemic. This is no real surprise considering the sectors that would typically invest in large machinery or manufacturing equipment, always tend to hold steady in a downturn. We saw the likes of manufacturing and construction continue to carry out new work to keep the country operating during this time. Not forgetting large commercial vehicles either - delivery drivers have been in high demand as the dominance of online deliveries surged while we all spent more time at home.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our economic growth is also a mark of commercial resilience, of businesses’ abilities to adapt, diversify and find new ways to sustain and grow against the odds. We witnessed this first-hand with our own client base, whereby <a href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/equipment-leasing">many continued to come to us to facilitate investments in new equipment that have enabled both growth in key sectors</a> and opened up businesses to completely new markets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;"><em>The compounding effects of Covid and Brexit, mean that for many, business simply can’t operate as usual.</em></h4>

<p style="text-align: center;">
	<br>
</p>

<p>Now, what makes this time around increasingly more challenging is that global supply chains in a post-pandemic world means longer transit times to reach markets. The compounding effects of Covid and Brexit, mean that for many, business simply can’t operate as usual. The shortage of lorry drivers is also impacting industry supply chains – with warnings from hauliers that they can no longer guarantee all pick-ups and deliveries. The likes of construction, manufacturing and farming are all reliant on a tight schedule of deliveries, so the impact of supply chain disruption is a monumental issue we need to overcome.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>4. How was lockdown for you?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>As we eagerly return to the office and enjoy our working days back with our colleagues, it’s hard to believe that we really were locked down for all of those many months.</p>

<p>When the first lockdown began, myself and my teams had to adapt very quickly to what became an ever-changing situation. We set up remote working facilities and did whatever we could to reassure our clients that we would continue to support them during these difficult times. It was challenging and the uncertainty of when we could go back to normal and what that would look like preyed on the minds of us all.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;"><em>The likes of Teams meetings and Zoom calls brought my teams closer together and we gained more opportunity to work as a collective and collaborate much more easily, as well as take the time to look after one another and develop great friendships.</em></h4>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>But for some, including myself, lockdown provided an unexpected opportunity to make positive changes to our lives. The likes of Teams meetings and Zoom calls brought my teams closer together and we gained more opportunity to work as a collective and collaborate much more easily, as well as take the time to look after one another and develop great friendships.</p>

<p>A lot of us spent more time appreciating the things we often took for granted, taking more time to do things we enjoy, spending time outside enjoying fresh air, and making time to speak with family and friends online or over the phone.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>5. During your career, what’s the best advice you’ve ever received, and what advice would you pass on to those just starting out in the sector?</strong></p>

<p>I’m passionate about creating a lasting change in the industry, which is why I will continue to take the steps necessary to improve diversity and inclusion within the workplace. One of the best things I’ve ever learned is that representation at a higher level can’t be changed overnight and starts by building from the bottom up. It’s what has guided me to spend my career working with candidates from all walks of life to ensure they have access to as many opportunities as possible to succeed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;"><em>As someone who has benefitted from mentorship and support from those around me, make sure you surround yourself with people who champion you and work hard to help you succeed.</em></h4>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>The best advice I can give to someone just starting out in the sector is to believe in yourself and grasp opportunities with both hands. As someone who has benefitted from mentorship and support from those around me, make sure you surround yourself with people who champion you and work hard to help you succeed.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>6. If you didn’t work in this industry, what alternative career would you have chosen?</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I can proudly say that I have loved every minute of my career. Having found the perfect job, there’s no other alternative career I could ever choose.</p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time Finance</a> are pleased to celebrate the success of their first Talent Leadership Programme – an initiative formed to recognise excellence from within and enhance the skills of the next generation of “future leaders”.</p>

<p>Launched in September 2020, 9 rising stars within the organisation (Alex Dowson; Charlotte Holley; Dan Hughes; Emma Edwards; John Cowham; Kate Brown; Matthew Sturney; Sophie Marsh; Tom Cook) were awarded placement due to their strong performance, drive and enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Over the course of the 12-month programme, the cohort were tasked with managing and delivering three large projects to the Operating Board at Time Finance: (1) investigate and recommend new products and services to compliment Time Finance’s existing portfolio of SME finance solutions; (2) launch a Group-wide intranet for their multi-site organisation; (3) explore and recommend the ways in which Time Finance can improve their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Environmental Social Governance (ESG).</p>

<p>Alongside the opportunity to project manage, the team benefited from internal mentorship from members of the Operating Board as well as external leadership coaching from a personal brand ambassador.</p>

<p><strong>Holly Mapstone, Director of HR, at Time Finance said:</strong> “At Time Finance, we put our employees at the heart of everything we do and pride ourselves on not only attracting great talent but continually investing in our people. Our Talent Leadership Programme was the first of its kind and was designed to help shape our employees into the next generation of future leaders. We want our employees to grow and thrive with us, and we firmly believe that access to training, mentorship, and the opportunity to take on new challenges is key.</p>

<p>“I was thrilled with the interest in the programme when it was first announced to our teams. We were inundated with applications from enthusiastic employees, ready to make a real difference in Time Finance. I’m delighted with the cohort we selected and the success of the programme. It’s a pleasure to see so many of our graduates already advance in their career in such a short space of time and go on to do great things.</p>

<p>Over the last 12 months, Dan Hughes, now Head of New Business <a href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/property-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">(Property Finance)</a>, has escalated into a management position and takes responsibility for a small team of advisors and building their new business pipeline. John Cowham, Financial Controller, has been appointed into a more senior position, now managing a larger team across multiple sites in the organisation. Kate Brown earned a promotion to Senior Marketing Manager, which included the recruitment of a new team member beneath her and the added responsibility of driving the firm’s marketing strategy. Matthew Sturney stepped up to a new role within management to oversee and drive new business in Time Finance’s <a href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/vendor-finance">Vendor Finance</a> division. Finally, both Tom Cook and Sophie Marsh were promoted into management positions.</p>

<p><strong>Ed Rimmer, Chief Executive Officer at Time Finance, said:</strong> “I would like to congratulate all employees who successfully graduated from this year’s Talent Leadership Programme. It’s proven to be a rewarding scheme not only for the business, but for our employees’ personal development plans. We look forward to continuing to explore new ways we can help our employees reach their full potential with us.”</p>

<p>The AIM listed alternative finance provider currently employs over 160 employees over 6 UK sites. Time Finance regularly engage in new initiatives and projects to support their employees and create an inclusive and market-leading workplace. In December 2020, Time Finance were named <a href="https://timefinance.com/press-releases/time-finance-named-employer-of-the-year">Employer of the Year</a> in the Business Leader Awards, recognising them for their commitment to their people.</p>]]></content>

		<slug><![CDATA[driving-change-demand-for-electric-vehicles-soars-by-241]]></slug>
		<published><![CDATA[2021-10-14 06:24:19]]></published>
		<updated><![CDATA[2021-10-14 06:24:19]]></updated>
		<content><![CDATA[<p>New data released by <a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time Finance</a> reveals a huge steer in direction from British Business, with a dramatic increase in demand for electric vehicles up 241% from last year.</p>

<p>The findings follow that from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) which announced that nearly 33,000 pure electric cars were registered in September - a record month for electric vehicles. With the government now reaching for a 78% reduction in emissions by 2025 and the sale of fuel-based vehicles due to be abolished altogether from 2030, these figures combined with those from Time Finance point towards continued growth in the uptake for wholly electric vehicles.</p>

<p>Alun Winter, who oversees the Vehicle Finance division at Time Finance, commented: “In recent years we have started to notice a small but increasing shift towards electric powered fleet solutions, for a number of different reasons, such as lower running costs, tax benefits and an increasing desire to contribute towards the UK’s net zero target. For these reasons alone it comes as no surprise that demand has continued to increase throughout 2021, but the most recent 241% rise in our electric solutions shows just how valued and important this industry is to the UK businesses we help to grow.</p>

<p>“These results also come at a time where a fuel shortage in the UK stunts the effectiveness of petrol - and diesel - powered fleets, whilst also shedding light on the absolute necessity for electric vehicle solutions to continue growth and to revolutionise the workforce across the UK.”</p>

<p>The increased demand for electric powered vehicles from Time Finance’s clients saw the Tesla 3 as the most desirable commercial vehicle by a staggering 75%. The Skoda Enyaq, BMW iX3, Nissan Leaf and Renault Zoe all followed in second place.</p>

<p>Vehicle investment amongst businesses has seen Time Finance bolster its variety of financial solutions to cater to growing demand. Earlier this year the business launched a brand-new platform on the Time Finance website which allows visitors to browse <a href="https://timefinance.com/vehicle-finance/special-offers" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">special offers</a> on electric vehicles. It’s vehicle finance and fleet solutions help businesses of all sizes source the vehicles they need and present the deal that best suits them, whether that’s affordability, term length, mileage type, additional features and much more. By spreading the cost of the securing these vehicles into manageable, monthly payments, investing in a new electric car or fleet can help firms achieve existing plans or help generate new lines of revenue.</p>

<p>Alun continued: “With this upward trajectory expected to continue in this industry, we’re committed to helping our clients achieve their growth plans and access the fleeting solutions they need. That’s why in July of this year we invested in our vehicle finance division and diversified this offering to make it easier for our customers to access our finance solutions.”</p>

<p>Time Finance offers a range of alternative finance solutions, including <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/asset-finance">Asset Finance</a>, <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance">Invoice Finance</a>, <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/loans">Loans</a> and <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/vehicle-finance">Vehicle Finance</a>, providing a suite of complementary solutions should businesses require a multi-product approach through <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/vehicle-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Asset-Based Lending</a>. In June this year, Time Finance also became an accredited lender under the Government’s Recovery Loan Scheme via the British Business Bank.</p>]]></content>

		<slug><![CDATA[1-in-3-businesses-to-invest-in-new-personnel-in-wake-of-furlough-ending]]></slug>
		<published><![CDATA[2021-10-19 06:55:11]]></published>
		<updated><![CDATA[2021-10-19 06:55:11]]></updated>
		<content><![CDATA[<p>Investing in new personnel has become a top priority for UK businesses, according to a recent survey conducted by <a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time Finance</a>. The alternative finance provider found that one in three firms are planning to expand their workforce, with 90% to start the recruitment process within the next 6 months.</p>

<p>The findings bring a welcomed degree of optimism amidst the ongoing challenges to the UK’s labour market, with unemployment rates anticipated to rise as the Government’s furlough scheme comes to an end.</p>

<p>Ed Rimmer, Chief Executive Officer at Time Finance, commented: “The Office of National Statistics recently revealed that a staggering 1.9 million people were still on Furlough at the end of June and with as many as one million workers expected to be on the scheme when it ended, there is a real concern that we could now be faced with a spike in unemployment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“There are, however, some clear indicators of business confidence that paint a much more optimistic picture. A considerable number of businesses are focusing their time and resources on the future and with a third of businesses planning to invest in new personnel, the coming months will bring an invaluable lifeline to those without work.</p>

<p>“It is encouraging that our survey mirrors new figures from the ONS that have shown that UK job vacancies have reached a 20-year high of 1.1 million. To me this suggests that the real challenge won’t be unemployment, but how businesses will compete to recruit the available workforce.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Our survey gives a really powerful barometer for the shift in business confidence over the last few months. In our previous survey in July this year, businesses’ plans for borrowing had a greater emphasis on stabilising cashflow and in just a few months this has shifted towards investment for growth. Respondents to our recent survey described their current outlook as optimistic despite much of the Government’s financial support drawing to a close, and to me this represents an important shift away from survival mode.”</p>

<p>Alongside personnel, business respondents also cited marketing (30%) and new products and services (27%) as well as operational and technological advancements (21%) as priorities for immediate investment.</p>

<p>Ed added: “Although recruiting new staff has become a top priority for businesses, interestingly many also have their eyes on additional means of growth, &nbsp;giving us a more detailed picture of business’ expansion strategies. Financial solutions therefore need to respond to these nuances. Finance should never attempt to provide a one-size-fits-all approach and our survey shows us that now, more than ever, businesses need a broad range of flexible finance solutions that can be tailored to their investment plans.</p>

<p>“There are, of course, going to be some challenges along the way. Investment in new personnel will be no mean feat when the UK is also facing a stark shortfall in the workforce, particularly in haulage, retail and many construction trades. A lack of available talent is a huge obstacle the UK faces and I would caution that alongside planned investments must come investments in training to ensure we up-skill at the rate UK businesses require.”</p>

		<content><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://timefinance.com/">Time Finance</a> has joined the charge to protect small businesses with a caution that the Government must focus on measures to accelerate SME growth in the Chancellor’s Autumn Budget on Wednesday 27 October.</p>

<p><strong>Ed Rimmer, Chief Executive Officer at Time Finance, comments:&nbsp;</strong>“We have seen some incredible signs of recovery and growth amongst our clients, the majority of whom have come out of the pandemic fighting. They are investing for growth, expanding their workforce, and investing in new products and services; all of that will be put in jeopardy if the Government does not put the correct systems in place. SMEs make up 99% of the UK’s business community and account for half of the turnover of the UK private sector; they create jobs and wealth and so their contributions to the economy are extremely valuable. Putting them at risk would also put the UK’s economic recovery at risk.</p>

<p>“The survival of small businesses and our continued economic recovery relies on two vital measures in the Chancellor’s Budget. First and foremost, the Government must make a pledge to safeguard taxes on small businesses. We don’t expect to see further changes to Corporation Tax; they would be unnecessary given the recent tax changes that are paying back into the treasury. I would also hope to see an extension to the retail rates relief to help the sector get back on its feet. The Uniform Business Rate is set to increase for 2022/23 in-line with the Consumer Price Index’s headline inflation of 3.1% for September, so revenue from business rates will grow. In my view that is reason enough to continue to give relief to those that need it most.</p>

<p>“Secondly, the Government must invest in skills training. The ONS recently reported that UK job vacancies were at a 20-year high, standing at 1.1 million with workforce shortages hitting construction and manufacturing the hardest. The Government needs to address this urgently and ensure its National Skills Fund fills the gaps in talent supply, caters to the areas of greatest need and furthermore, that it feeds directly into the recruitment needs of the business community.</p>

<p>“I don’t think any of us envy the task at hand for the Chancellor. Rebuilding the public finances will require a lot of tough decisions but there are some good signs of recovery. This will undoubtedly be aided by the recent agreement reached by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to implement a global minimum corporation tax rate of 15%. This is good news received with caution; the Government must now look at its own legislation to ensure there are no loopholes under this new threshold. There has also been rumour that the new threshold could result in the loss of the relatively new digital service tax, a valuable revenue stream that the Government should safeguard. There is no question that a lot has been done to support the 6 million SMEs in the UK over the past 18 months. Now is no time to undo that great work.”</p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Ed Rimmer, Chief Executive Officer at Time Finance, shares his thoughts:</strong> “This needed to be a Budget for growth, not for paying back. We have seen some real substance from the Government that growth is their number one priority. As the Chancellor said, we have not drawn a line under Covid. But we are entering a new age of optimism.</p>

<p>“The series of business rates relief will be universally good news for the retail, hospitality and leisure industries but I think the biggest gift the Chancellor has given on this tax system is the business rates improvement relief. This is an exceptional decision by the Government, giving businesses a leg up to growth. These measures to incentivise growth put real substance to the Government’s ambition to deliver a stronger economy. What’s more, the investment relief to encourage investment in green technology will help businesses make key investments in sustainability and this is an important catalyst for our net zero targets.</p>

<p>“The Chancellor’s new Charter for Budget Responsibility will possibly be the most promising announcement in today’s Budget, namely due to its emphasis on borrowing and its sole purpose for growth investment. This separation is vital to our economic growth. Delivering a stronger economy in the wake of the pandemic is a bold ambition, but given some of the ORB's reporting there are some very clear indicators that we are recovering much quicker than anticipated.</p>

<p><strong>“</strong>The Government’s ambitious growth strategy paints a very promising picture of economy growth and I’m very pleased to see some real measures being put in place to support the needs of the business community and safeguard their role in economic investment. Increasing skills spending by 42% is very welcome news for businesses, particularly those struggling with a lack of available talent. But this alone won’t solve the skills shortage. We need to see more detail on the proposed Scale Up Visa, which will bring in international skills. To be as effective as our businesses require, this visa needs to not just support research and development but also support the struggling industries that are the back-bone of our economy, not least logistics and construction.</p>

<p>“Despite the rumours, there has been no clarity on the 6-month extension to the Recovery Loan Scheme, which would have been welcome news to businesses who are yet to return to their pre-Covid operations. We are yet to see if this rumour will be substantiated, but either way, what we need to understand about the Recovery Loan Scheme is its wider implications on alternative funding solutions. RLS does what it needs to; it’s a cheap source of funding to aid recovery. That said, there was a huge emphasis on economic growth in today’s budget and there are a multitude of alternatives to RLS that can be much more effective in facilitating business growth.”</p>

<p>“We are yet to see some substance from the Government on how Levelling Up will benefit local businesses. Economic growth and skills investment are two major points in the Levelling Up agenda, however despite investments in infrastructure, the business community needs to know the practical implications Levelling Up will have on them.”</p>

		<updated><![CDATA[2021-11-04 08:24:32]]></updated>
		<content><![CDATA[<p>New data from Time Finance reveals that an astonishing 70% of businesses are suffering from late payments from their customers. Uncovering the true severity of the issue, the leading alternative finance provider found that late payment debt was as high as £200,000 for 1 in 5 business owners.</p>

<p>The findings come despite the Government introducing a Prompt Payment Code which was put in place to ensure small businesses receive payment for 95% of their invoices within 30 days from customers who are signed up to the pledge. 72% of business owners told <a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time Finance</a> they were unsure <a href="https://timefinance.com/time-blog/prompt-payment-code-reforms-fall-short-for-smes" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Prompt Payment Code</a> goes far enough to tackle the late payment culture and of the 16% who said it wouldn’t go far enough, almost two thirds put this down to a lack of enforceability.</p>

<p>Phil Chesham, Head of <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Invoice Finance</a> at Time Finance, commented: “We have always known that the UK’s late payment culture is a huge threat to businesses, but our survey has shed light on the true scale of the issue, and it appears to be getting worse.</p>

<p>“When the Government announced its reforms to the Prompt Payment Code in January, it was accompanied with a pledge that it would tackle late payment and protect jobs. The steps taken have been too small and are clearly not having the required impact. We’re finding that 69% of small businesses fail to receive payment from their customers within the agreed 30-day payment term and are often left waiting 60, 90 or 120 days. This is unacceptable.</p>

<p>“The potential in that outstanding revenue is enormous; that money could be working capital that a business invests in new people, new equipment, new premises or new markets. Unpaid invoices, in my opinion, equate to missed opportunity.”</p>

<p>Time Finance’s Invoice Finance solutions can release up to 90% of the funds tied up in unpaid invoices. With facilities ranging between £10,000 and £2.5million, businesses are no longer held back by a lack of cashflow from late payments and have the financial freedom to reinvest and grow. <a href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/outsourced-credit-control">Their optional credit control service can take the strain away from chasing payments</a> and protect customer relationships.</p>

<p>Phil continued: “<a href="https://timefinance.com/time-blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-cashflow-financing">UK businesses require solutions that relieve pressure on their cash flow</a>, protect them from potential closure and enable them to invest for the future. What we see in our invoice finance team is that our clients need to have measures in place to mitigate late payment and unlock working capital so that they can reinvest back into the business. Spending time chasing late payment can have wider implications for a business, so our optional credit control service removes this strain, giving business owners the headroom to grow.”</p>]]></content>

<p>The findings come despite the Government introducing a Prompt Payment Code which was put in place to ensure small businesses receive payment for 95% of their invoices within 30 days from customers who are signed up to the pledge. 72% of business owners told <a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time Finance</a> they were unsure <a href="https://timefinance.com/time-blog/prompt-payment-code-reforms-fall-short-for-smes" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Prompt Payment Code</a> goes far enough to tackle the late payment culture and of the 16% who said it wouldn’t go far enough, almost two thirds put this down to a lack of enforceability.</p>

<p>Phil Chesham, Head of <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Invoice Finance</a> at Time Finance, commented: “We have always known that the UK’s late payment culture is a huge threat to businesses, but our survey has shed light on the true scale of the issue, and it appears to be getting worse.</p>

<p>“When the Government announced its reforms to the Prompt Payment Code in January, it was accompanied with a pledge that it would tackle late payment and protect jobs. The steps taken have been too small and are clearly not having the required impact. We’re finding that 69% of small businesses fail to receive payment from their customers within the agreed 30-day payment term and are often left waiting 60, 90 or 120 days. This is unacceptable.</p>

<p>“The potential in that outstanding revenue is enormous; that money could be working capital that a business invests in new people, new equipment, new premises or new markets. Unpaid invoices, in my opinion, equate to missed opportunity.”</p>

<p>Time Finance’s Invoice Finance solutions can release up to 90% of the funds tied up in unpaid invoices. With facilities ranging between £10,000 and £2.5million, businesses are no longer held back by a lack of cashflow from late payments and have the financial freedom to reinvest and grow. <a href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/outsourced-credit-control">Their optional credit control service can take the strain away from chasing payments</a> and protect customer relationships.</p>

<p>Phil continued: “<a href="https://timefinance.com/time-blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-cashflow-financing">UK businesses require solutions that relieve pressure on their cash flow</a>, protect them from potential closure and enable them to invest for the future. What we see in our invoice finance team is that our clients need to have measures in place to mitigate late payment and unlock working capital so that they can reinvest back into the business. Spending time chasing late payment can have wider implications for a business, so our optional credit control service removes this strain, giving business owners the headroom to grow.”</p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time Finance</a>, the leading alternative finance provider, are pleased to announce that they have renewed their back-to-back facility with RBSIF with a new 3-year deal. The £50m facility, which will be used exclusively to provide an increase in <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Invoice Finance&nbsp;</a>facilities to business owners throughout the UK, is the important next stage in the firm’s ambitious growth plans.</p>

<p>The deal comes on the back of what has been a challenging eighteen months for business. Throughout the pandemic, Time Finance remained committed to enabling businesses to access a funding solution which met their requirements and more recently have seen an increase in the level of funding requests as firms put all their efforts into building back to pre-Covid levels. This increased facility will see Time Finance support more firms through invoice finance facilities than ever before.</p>

<p><strong>Phil Chesham, Head of Invoice Finance, commented:</strong> “Securing this increased funding facility is a significant boost to Time Finance and is reflective of the confidence RBSIF have in our business and the vital funding support we provide to firms across the UK. It not only supports our ambitious growth plans, but it also means that we are able to make available additional funding to SMEs looking to access funding and take their business to the next level. Our team work closely with our clients and have seen first-hand the difference the right funding solution can make to the success of a firm’s plans”.</p>

<p>Invoice Finance is an increasingly popular choice for firms looking to improve their cashflow to support day to day running costs as well as investing in growth. With facilities of up to £2.5m available, Time Finance are looking forward to providing the confidence that a secured funding facility provides.</p>

<p><strong>Paul Morgan, Director, RBS Invoice Finance commented</strong> “We have supported the management team at Time Finance now since 2013 and are absolutely delighted to be extending our support and relationship with them for the next three years. As the economy continues to recover from the pandemic, having access to funding and liquidity to drive growth has never been more important and the renewal of the back-to-back facility ensures Time Finance continue to have access to the funding required to continue supporting their existing and new customers to achieve their goals”.</p>

<p>Time Finance also specialise in the provision or arrangement of <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/asset-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Asset Finance</a>,<a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/loans" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Loan</a> and <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/vehicle-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vehicle Finance</a> solutions. Since the beginning of the pandemic, Time Finance has been working hard to help its customers through this turbulent period and the addition of both CBILS and more recently the RLS provided firms with the flexibility of funding options they needed to have the confidence to plan forward.</p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<p>Late payments are threatening the survival of British businesses, in-depth analysis by leading alternative finance provider, <a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time Finance</a>, reveals. Uncovering the true impact of late payments, Time Finance found that challenges with cashflow and unfulfilled growth ambitions were the greatest knock-on effects holding businesses back.</p>

<p>For 70% of SMEs, late payments are a recurring issue leading to more severe consequences with over 40% worrying about their own cashflow as a result. Recent figures from the Federation of Small Businesses estimate that 50,000 businesses close each year due to late payments.</p>

<p>Time Finance found that less than one in three businesses are paid by their customers within the agreed 30 days terms, with an astonishing 70% waiting more than 60, 90 or 120 days. For some firms, this leaves them in a crippling position with a quarter struggling to pay HMRC.</p>

<p>Surveying the trusted advisors of business owners, Time Finance uncovered that 42% believe that late payments from customers was one of the greatest challenges and threats hampering business success, and one in ten are concerned for anticipated insolvency as a result. Suffering customer service levels, hindered growth plans and pressure on cashflow were cited as the top three negative impacts on business growth from late payments.</p>

<p>As a result of <a href="https://timefinance.com/time-blog/late-invoice-payments-what-to-do">customers not paying their invoices on time</a>, almost one in three businesses also fear their relationships with customers are negatively affected due to chasing payments, whilst over one third struggle to pay their own invoices or their own employees on time.</p>

<p>Phil Chesham, Head of Invoice Finance at Time Finance, commented: “The UK’s late payment culture is plagued by a real domino effect and can perpetuate much wider problems. There are a number of worrying things we can see in our statistics. Businesses have to spend money to make money, but how can they do this if their potential working capital is tied up in unpaid invoices? We can see businesses being held back by late payment and this then has wider consequences for the UK economy. Our economic recovery and growth relies on the recovery and growth of businesses. If one is stunted, so is the other.</p>

<p>“What’s more, our survey found that for many businesses chasing payments negatively impacts their relationships with their own customers and as a result almost one third struggle to pay their own invoices on time; this truly demonstrates the vicious cycle that late payments can create. Businesses must work together to ensure that tackling the culture around late payments is a business priority – as we’ve seen already with the introduction of the Prompt Payment Code, legislation alone won’t fix this.</p>

Our <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance">Invoice Finance</a> solutions enable businesses to unlock working capital from the value of their unpaid invoices, giving them the financial freedom to reinvest in their business and grow. We recognise that chasing payments from customers can be an uncomfortable process and takes up a substantial part of the working day. <a href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/outsourced-credit-control">Our professional credit control teams</a> take the strain of that away, leaving firms to focus on more important things – like running their business.”</p>]]></content>

		<published><![CDATA[2021-11-30 09:52:23]]></published>
		<updated><![CDATA[2021-11-30 09:52:23]]></updated>
		<content><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time Finance</a> are delighted to announce that they have supported their client, <a href="https://aandbcontractors.wixsite.com/abcontractors">A &amp; B Contractors</a>, with a £750,000 Invoice Finance and £100,000 XtraTime facility, as they use the funding to help harvest their ambitious growth plans.</p>

<p>Established in 1989, A &amp; B Contractors was set up by Richard Barrow, an entrepreneurial farmer with exciting plans for the future. Having grown his business year-on-year, it now stands as a large and successful agricultural contracting firm with a highly skilled workforce of over 40 employees behind it. Offering a wide range of farming services, from harvesting crops to ploughing and bailing, the firm operates a fleet of 30 tractors to cover all aspects of farming. As they later moved into groundworks, offering tarmacking, concreting and paving services, they invested in a range of heavy plant pieces of machinery.</p>

<p>They first established their relationship with Time Finance back in 2018 in their search for a relationship-driven funding partner who could <a href="https://timefinance.com/time-blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-cashflow-financing">help them to ease cash flow and support their plans for further investment</a>. Time Finance packaged an <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/asset-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Asset Finance</a> solution which gave A &amp; B the flexibility to re-finance their existing farming equipment and release £88,000 back into the business.</p>

<p>With much of their work driven by seasonality, and spring and summer producing peak sales, earlier this year they once again found themselves in need of funding to bridge their cashflow gap. This time Invoice Finance was the ideal solution, raising funding against the value of their unpaid invoices. Working closely with TSF Finance who introduced the facility, Time Finance were able to swiftly package a £750,000 Invoice Finance facility to provide an immediate cash injection into the business. In addition Time Finance packaged an additional £100,000 through an XTRA Time overpayment, to provide A &amp; B with further headroom for growth.</p>

<p><strong>Richard Barrow, Managing Director at A &amp; B Contractors, said:&nbsp;</strong>“When it comes to growing your business, it’s vital to have a supportive funding partner who really gets to know you and what you need to do to take it to the next level. As soon as we met with the team at Time Finance, we felt confident in their understanding of our business and their flexible approach to meeting our needs.”</p>

<p><strong>Simon Holian, Business Development Manager at Time Finance, said:</strong> “It’s been a pleasure to support Richard and the team. We took the time to understand their business and tailor a funding facility that would tackle the immediate cash flow issues caused by seasonality but be flexible and provide enough headroom to fuel their future growth plans.</p>

		<updated><![CDATA[2021-11-30 09:52:23]]></updated>
		<content><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time Finance</a> are delighted to announce that they have supported their client, <a href="https://aandbcontractors.wixsite.com/abcontractors">A &amp; B Contractors</a>, with a £750,000 Invoice Finance and £100,000 XtraTime facility, as they use the funding to help harvest their ambitious growth plans.</p>

<p>Established in 1989, A &amp; B Contractors was set up by Richard Barrow, an entrepreneurial farmer with exciting plans for the future. Having grown his business year-on-year, it now stands as a large and successful agricultural contracting firm with a highly skilled workforce of over 40 employees behind it. Offering a wide range of farming services, from harvesting crops to ploughing and bailing, the firm operates a fleet of 30 tractors to cover all aspects of farming. As they later moved into groundworks, offering tarmacking, concreting and paving services, they invested in a range of heavy plant pieces of machinery.</p>

<p>They first established their relationship with Time Finance back in 2018 in their search for a relationship-driven funding partner who could <a href="https://timefinance.com/time-blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-cashflow-financing">help them to ease cash flow and support their plans for further investment</a>. Time Finance packaged an <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/asset-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Asset Finance</a> solution which gave A &amp; B the flexibility to re-finance their existing farming equipment and release £88,000 back into the business.</p>

<p>With much of their work driven by seasonality, and spring and summer producing peak sales, earlier this year they once again found themselves in need of funding to bridge their cashflow gap. This time Invoice Finance was the ideal solution, raising funding against the value of their unpaid invoices. Working closely with TSF Finance who introduced the facility, Time Finance were able to swiftly package a £750,000 Invoice Finance facility to provide an immediate cash injection into the business. In addition Time Finance packaged an additional £100,000 through an XTRA Time overpayment, to provide A &amp; B with further headroom for growth.</p>

<p><strong>Richard Barrow, Managing Director at A &amp; B Contractors, said:&nbsp;</strong>“When it comes to growing your business, it’s vital to have a supportive funding partner who really gets to know you and what you need to do to take it to the next level. As soon as we met with the team at Time Finance, we felt confident in their understanding of our business and their flexible approach to meeting our needs.”</p>

<p><strong>Simon Holian, Business Development Manager at Time Finance, said:</strong> “It’s been a pleasure to support Richard and the team. We took the time to understand their business and tailor a funding facility that would tackle the immediate cash flow issues caused by seasonality but be flexible and provide enough headroom to fuel their future growth plans.</p>

<p>“We pride ourselves on being easy to deal with so that our clients get the financial support they need to thrive, quickly and efficiently. Our relationship with A&amp;B demonstrates just that.”</p>

		<content><![CDATA[<p>A new Chester networking event organised by Bathgate Business Finance with support from <a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time Finance </a>has raised £900 for Melanoma UK.</p>

<p>Following the success of its Monday afternoon golfing events, the team at Bathgate decided to introduce a new regular social event to Chester’s networking calendar, for those who are more comfortable off the green.</p>

<p>The first Friday evening socials took place in October and November at The Cornerhouse on City Road, with finance professionals, solicitors and representatives from a host of other professional services coming together to enjoy drinks, pizza and plenty of conversation.</p>

<p>Five pounds from every ticket sold was donated to Melanoma UK, and additional donations of £100 each from Bathgate Business Finance, Time Finance and Auteur Media, bringing the total raised to £900.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Bathgate BDM and event organiser, Ian Adams, said: “Our new event has been warmly welcomed into Chester’s social calendar. It was fantastic to bring even more professionals together for an evening of relaxed networking and to raise money for an excellent charity.</p>

<p>“Melanoma UK is a cause close to my heart as a family member had a malignant melanoma. Thankfully they identified this early enough, but many are not as lucky. Melanoma UK does a fantastic job of supporting patients and their families, and the funds raised will go to excellent use.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Andy Hume, from Time Finance, said: “We were delighted to be able to support Melanoma UK at Bathgate Business Finance’s networking event. Not only were we glad to be back spending time with the Chester professional community but to have helped raised £900 for such a worthwhile cause in the process is amazing. It was a great afternoon… and evening!”</p>

<p>Diane Cannon, Corporate Partnerships Director at Melanoma UK said: “The pandemic has had a devastating impact on Melanoma UK. &nbsp;With no government funding, all our events being cancelled overnight and we really didn’t know if we could weather the storm until ‘normal’ returned. But with the support from generous organisations such as Bathgate Business Finance, Time Finance and Auteur Media, we did and we are still here supporting more patients as a result.</p>

<p>“We are very fortunate and grateful to have Bathgate Business Finance as a very loyal and dedicated supporter. &nbsp;They really have gone the extra mile for us over a number of years and this most recent initiative combined business networking and paying it forward for charity. Melanoma UK would like to thank everyone involved in the new Chester Networking event and long may it continue.”</p>

<p>Chester Social Networking will be a quarterly event in 2022, returning in February. Stay tuned to our website for further updates.</p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time Finance</a> are delighted to announce that they have appointed Michael Freebury as Head of Sales in their <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Invoice Finance</a> team to drive business growth in Wales.

<p>Michael joins with a wealth of experience and a credible reputation having worked in the business finance sector for over 25 years. Starting his career as a Business Development Manager at Bibby Financial Services, Michael worked alongside introducers to help UK business owners access Invoice Finance solutions.

In his most recent role as Head of Sales he was responsible for generating awareness of Bibby’s product offerings across the South Wales and South West regions of England.</p>

<p><strong>Speaking of his appointment, Michael comments:&nbsp;</strong>"I’m excited to start the next stage of my career with Time Finance.

<p><strong>Phil Chesham, Head of Invoice Finance at Time Finance, added:</strong> "Over the last few months, we’ve witnessed a significant rise in demand for Invoice Finance, both from introducers and business owners, and off the back of that are continuing to invest in our presence across the UK.</p>

<p>“Michael’s appointment is an important part of our growth plan to continue bringing excellent talent into our firm and respond to the rise in demand for funding support. I’m confident that with Michael’s arrival we will be able to further bolster our support to businesses in his region.”</p>

		<content><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>In his latest guest blog with Time Finance, Ed Rimmer shares why he believes 2022 will be the year for big investment among British businesses:</strong></em></p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>The new year never fails to give us a fresh perspective. Whether we are resolved to put the past year’s challenges behind us or energised to achieve new ambitions in the months ahead, the start of a new year lifts the fog of December and brings business priorities into sharp focus. Investment plays a big role here and always has, but there are many indicators that 2022 will see an even greater emphasis on strategic business investment. As always, alternative finance must stay ahead of the game to ensure we provide the right funding support for businesses. Here are my predictions for the role of alternative finance in the year ahead.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h4><strong>The increased potential of Invoice Finance</strong></h4>

<p><a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Invoice Finance</a> continues to be an extremely valuable means of releasing additional working capital to help a business’ cashflow and fuel investment, and appetite for this service is only set to grow. It is such a versatile funding solution that enables businesses to be nimble in how they use their capital. It can provide a buffer for short term overhead challenges or provide a means for growth whether that’s investing in new equipment, introducing new products and services onto the market, or making acquisitions.. Economically, businesses are still navigating a lot of unknowns and so they need flexibility in their funding to enable them to react quickly. Invoice Finance provides that in abundance but it also provides a funding stream that grows with a business, making it a perfect fit for businesses mapping their future ambitions.</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<h4><strong>Sustainable investment trends</strong></h4>

<p>COP26 succeeded in igniting a fresh urgency in the global movement against climate change. For businesses already focused on sustainability, this will have brought their attention back to ways they can further reduce their carbon footprint and for businesses yet to make any green improvements, it undoubtedly moved sustainability higher up their agenda. But regardless of where a business’ environmental credentials sit, investment in sustainability is expensive. We at <a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time Finance </a>have kickstarted the year with our ‘Going Green’ survey to better understand what our clients need from us to aid their sustainability strategies. We found that 40% of businesses simply can’t afford to invest in green tech while 40% have other priorities for investment. It is the job of alternative finance to find ways to break down those barriers for businesses and provide funding solutions that turn a green wish list into an achievable investment plan.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h4><strong>The agility of alternative funding</strong></h4>

<p>Traditional lending is failing to keep up with the needs of businesses. The businesses that we work with come to us because we have multiple and flexible funding products and services that can be tailored to meet their business needs. We are not simply a pot of money handed over with conditions and a repayment plan. We work with businesses to understand their needs and develop solutions that suit their current and future objectives. In 2022, businesses will really need this. Agility, flexibility and, in many cases, speed, are what businesses require from their funding streams. This year is going to see a big shift in where businesses turn for their funding. They need funders who are easy to deal with, have a common sense approach to doing business and react quickly. This is where I truly believe our industry leads the way.</p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>2022 is set to be a year of enormous change for businesses and for the first time in two years, this change is exciting. There are innovations to embrace, opportunities to seize and expansion plans to fulfil. Our very own Sharon Bryden, Director of </em></strong><a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/loans" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong><em>Commercial Loans</em></strong></a><strong><em>&nbsp;and </em></strong><a href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/asset-based-lending" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong><em>Asset Based Lending</em></strong></a><strong><em>, shares her predictions for the year ahead and thoughts on how we can all step up our support to make 2022 the year of ambitious growth and prosperity for UK businesses.</em></strong></p>

<p>Businesses have shown a defiant response to the challenges of the past two years, and this has been rewarded with promising, albeit wavering, signs of recovery and growth. Just recently, the Office of National Statistics found that 85% of business owners are feeling confident about survival as 2021 draws to a close. Although the economy’s growth slowed towards the end of the year, confidence reigns strong. What this tells us is that in the face of adversity, businesses diversify, survive and thrive against the odds. This optimism and outlook puts us on a strong footing for a stable economy in 2022.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h4><strong>So, what will businesses be looking for in 2022?&nbsp;</strong></h4>

<p>I am almost certain it isn’t simply to stay afloat. Business owners are, by nature, driven and ambitious and their entrepreneurial spirit has been amplified over the past two years with the emergence of new products and services that have opened up new markets. Keeping an eye on cashflow has of course been a necessity, but a good business owner will always look to the future. They will have one eye on restoring cash in the business and another on bringing forward their investment plans. Whether that’s developing new products, expanding into new markets, or adopting innovations to transform the way they do things. All of that requires investment.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h4><strong>What will the biggest areas of investment look like over the next 12 months?</strong></h4>

<p>2022 is going to be the year that smaller businesses really start to think (and invest) like big businesses. One thing to come out of the Covid-19 pandemic was businesses’ ability to adapt to changing market conditions. They became more agile, and that will continue, but 2022 will be the year that they move away from a spending freeze and take a more forward-thinking approach to investment.</p>

<p>Investment in new tech, particularly in eco-friendly equipment and Artificial Intelligence (AI), will be high on the agenda and will enable businesses to harness innovative systems to stay at the top of their game, while operating more sustainably and diversifying to accommodate market changes. AI will also play a vital role in industries that have suffered recent labour and skills shortages, enabling sectors to source new and more efficient ways to deliver projects, which will in-turn improve economic productivity.</p>

<p>2022 will also see other key areas of investment that respond to the changing world around us. Spending on product research and development is a trend we expect to continue to see in 2022, particularly in light of the tax relief that businesses can benefit from when investing in innovation. For the first time in a long time, businesses have a bit of breathing space to look at what they offer and interrogate how they could do things differently, which will allow them to bring fresh ideas to market to stay ahead of the competition.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h4><strong>Will caution remain in 2022?</strong></h4>

<p>Businesses have understandably been protective of any cash reserves they may have in 2021. But that isn’t to say investment hasn’t been on the agenda; simply that it has been strategically geared towards well thought-out business needs. In September this year, we conducted a survey of small businesses and found that 35% were planning investment in new personnel while 33% were planning investment in new equipment - and 80% planned on making those investments using alternative finance through a financial intermediary. Intent has been there, appetite is strong, and the right types of finance must be there to accommodate the demand.</p>

<p>We are still very much in the realm of stabilising the economy and similarly, businesses are still balancing the books. They need to restore working capital so that they can react fast to sudden and unexpected changes, or indeed opportunities, and alternative finance will be vital here. Traditional lenders will become far more restrictive and inaccessible in 2022 so our multi-product funding solutions will have a very big role to play in helping businesses gear up for a more stable economy.</p>

<p><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>

<h4><strong>Strategic partnerships will be more important in 2022</strong></h4>

<p>The importance of the sustainability agenda really hit home at COP26 and for many businesses, it was a time to reflect on what they were doing to help fight climate change. But even if a business operates in the greenest way possible, its carbon footprint also depends on its supply chain. 2022 will be a year when businesses become far more discerning when partnering with suppliers. With the right financial planning in place, a business will not be deterred from investing in new partnerships with more ethically minded suppliers.</p>

<p>Small businesses will be looking to the finance industry for flexible and accessible funding solutions to help in that drive for innovation and change. As has always been the case in alternative finance, one size will not fit all, but what I do expect to see is some huge appetite for multiple products that provide a package of finance solutions so that businesses are able to unlock the exciting potential 2022 will bring.</p>]]></content>

		<updated><![CDATA[2022-01-20 16:14:00]]></updated>
		<content><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time Finance</a> are delighted to announce that they have introduced a new Secured Lending product to support the growth and investment plans of British businesses throughout 2022 and beyond.</p>

<p>In response to an increased demand for finance from UK SMEs as they enter the New Year and put investment at the top of their agenda, Time Finance have doubled their Secured Loan offering to businesses from £250,000 to £500,000. The facility can be used to support a wide range of growth plans from investing in new products, vital machinery, or property, to resolving cashflow issues. Whatever the need, funding lines from £50,000 will be available to help realise those business objectives.</p>

<p>The launch is driven by Sharon Bryden, Director of Commercial Loans &amp; <a href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/asset-based-lending" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Asset Based Lending</a> at Time Finance, who joined the firm in 2021 to help bolster funding support to business owners across the UK. It complements the firm’s existing Commercial Loan offering which already enables UK SMEs to take advantage of Unsecured Loans and VAT loans up to £50,000.</p>

<p><strong>As Sharon Bryden comments:</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>"UK businesses have had a challenging time over the last two years and with Government support initiatives at an end and needing to be repaid, the need to access funds to meet both normal operating expenses and to provide the capital to invest for future growth has heightened. Whilst commercial loans have been part of our portfolio since our inception over two decades ago, there is a renewed ambition to enhance this flexible solution for businesses. Based on feedback from our intermediary network, our new secured loan product is easy to set up and fast to access, giving business owners a solution that supports any number of business initiatives. It complements our existing portfolio of funding solutions and means we can help even more firms realise their plans.”</p>

<p>Time Finance specialise in the provision or arrangement of funding solutions to UK businesses seeking to access the finance they need to realise their growth plans, from <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/asset-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Asset Finance</a> to<a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&nbsp;Invoice Finance</a>, <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/loans" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Loans</a> and <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/vehicle-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vehicle Finance</a>. As the market continues to improve, Time Finance are confident that the business is well positioned to take advantage of the increasing number of opportunities that are arising as the new year gets underway.</p>

<p>With a diverse portfolio of funding solutions, the business can already offer a multiproduct solution to businesses seeking a higher level of funding across multiple assets, but they have plans to continue strengthening their offering and truly deliver a market leading Asset Based lending proposition to support their future ambitions.</p>

<p><strong>As Sharon concludes:&nbsp;</strong>"At Time Finance, we recognise the important role businesses are playing in rebuilding our economies. We are committed to delivering robust funding solutions to these businesses to inspire growth. We have ambitious plans to drive change in the market and step up support for SMEs. Our ability to provide funding for every business need is key to being able to provide the right funding solution to our clients”.</p>]]></content>

		<updated><![CDATA[2022-01-20 10:20:07]]></updated>
		<content><![CDATA[<p align="center" style="text-align: left;"><strong>UK businesses have had a rollercoaster of a ride over the last two years with many able to ride out the storm with the ongoing commitment of their funders and the generous round of support initiatives put in place by the Government. One thing has become clear – the importance of good financial planning can make or break a business when the going gets tough. Phil Chesham explains why we all should be encouraging clients to put a financial strategy in place and what they need to consider from a funder’s perspective if seeking out funding.</strong></p>

<p>We all recognise the importance of SMEs to our economy. There are 5.5 million of them representing 99.9% of all businesses, accounting for 16.3 million jobs (61% of the national total) and a combined turnover of around £2.3 trillion (52% of the nation). When these businesses face a tough time, the livelihoods of millions of people are at stake as is the UK’s economic health. This is why we all – funders and their advisors - need to ensure that they have a finance strategy in place to support their businesses in good times and in bad.</p>

<p>Finance strategies need to take a long-term view. During the pandemic, businesses benefited from the Government support measures in the form of loans but also a reduction in expenses such as rates relief whilst also having the option of putting back HMRC payments. With the worst of the pandemic behind us, businesses need to recover and grow to support economic growth. The burden of paying back these loans, however, is now a reality. Recent statistics showed that 88% of UK SMEs received some sort of support from financial institutions and/or the Government - 35% of which are now concerned about their ability to repay. Not surprisingly, 51% also list one of their challenges as recovering from the pandemic, indicating that they will likely require ongoing support from financial institutions.</p>

<p>It is therefore crucial that we work together to do everything we can to support businesses and help them put a financial plan in place to ensure it covers these repayments but also gives firms the flexibility to continue building back from the pandemic and investing in their business growth over the coming years. Ensuring fast and easy access to funding when required will be fundamental.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h4><strong>1. Understand what the objective is</strong></h4>

<p>Having clarity on what your client is trying to achieve not just in the short term but long term. Many businesses have been seeking out cashflow solutions to support survival but as time passes funding will be required to support long term committed repayments and investing for growth. Thinking this through can help secure a robust funding solution from the outset.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h4><strong>2. Do your due diligence</strong></h4>

<p>Most businesses want fast access to a funding solution, but the process can be held up because relevant information is not available meaning that the funder does not have full transparency on what is going on in the business from a finance perspective and cannot establish its overall general health. They should at the very least:</p>

<p>▪ Ensure they have at least 2 full sets of management accounts (and possibly longer if their business has been impacted by the pandemic and they want to demonstrate how it performed pre-Covid)</p>

<p>▪ Sell their potential, which is critical so be able to demonstrate past, existing, and future incomes</p>

<p>▪ Be clear on the assets they own – machinery and equipment – and if they are owned or financed</p>

<p>▪ Be upfront about their liabilities and any payment plans in place to cover Government loans or HMRC arrears</p>

<p>▪ Understand their cost base – paying attention to areas that may have reduced during the last two years, but which will be re-established</p>

<p>▪ Revisit their business plans to understand the cost required to make these plans happen</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h4><strong>3. Be clear on how much funding your client needs</strong></h4>

<p>Having done your due diligence, you and your client will be clearer on what level of funding is required. This helps both the funder but also the business as it helps with forward planning. In uncertain times there can be a tendency to err on the cautious side and to take as little as they need but having a flexible supply of funding to enable them to maximise opportunities as they arise is so important. Putting a funding solution in place that is inadequate means you would need to go through the whole process again which is inefficient use of resources.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h4><strong>4. Choose the right financial solution(s) not just the most common</strong></h4>

<p>When determining the right funding solution, businesses can sometimes opt to take the first solution offered by their bank. But this might not be the right solution for their business and what they are trying to achieve. It can be daunting to decide which option is best but the advice that financial advisors give can be invaluable. Your knowledge of what is on offer and what funders are like to work with can ensure a right match for your client.</p>

<p>Outside of the traditional loans and overdrafts that a bank will focus on there is a range of alternative finance solutions that support a business in different ways. As an alternative funder, Time Finance can offer an extensive portfolio of solutions:</p>

<p><a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/asset-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>Asset Finance</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>– enables the purchase or lease of vital business machinery and equipment to make business happen. We can also offer options which support the refinancing of existing equipment to provide an injection of funds back into the business</p>

<p><a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/loans" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>Commercial Loans</strong> </a>– both unsecured and secured - a flexible source of funds to support current and future plans</p>

<p><a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>Invoice Finance</strong></a> – providing an upfront injection of funds and ongoing cash against invoices as they are raised ensuring the business has improved cashflow to bring plans to life</p>

<p><a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/vehicle-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>Vehicle Finance</strong> </a>– from a single car to funding your fleet, spreading the cost over time keeps you on the road</p>

<p><a href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/property-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>Property Finance</strong></a> – if you’re buying a property or refurbishing a property, we can make this happen</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h4><strong>5. Choose the right funder</strong></h4>

<p>Funders are all different and a client will only understand that after they have started working for them. This is where financial advisors can deliver real value. You have experience of how different funders work with clients. How do they rate in terms of speed, accessibility, flexibility and being easy to do business with? Matching your client to the right funding partner is an important part of the whole process. We are a people business, and we recognise the importance of effective working relationships in helping your clients realise their objectives.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h4><strong>6. Review, Communicate, Adapt</strong></h4>

<p>Nothing is certain! Things will change. Make sure you have regular review sessions to understand where the business is, how their funding solutions are working form them and what if anything needs to change. Make sure you continue communicating with the funder – by keeping them in the loop and avoiding any surprises makes for a smooth and beneficial relationship.</p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<p align="center" style="text-align: left;"><strong>UK businesses have had a rollercoaster of a ride over the last two years with many able to ride out the storm with the ongoing commitment of their funders and the generous round of support initiatives put in place by the Government. One thing has become clear – the importance of good financial planning can make or break a business when the going gets tough. Phil Chesham explains why we all should be encouraging clients to put a financial strategy in place and what they need to consider from a funder’s perspective if seeking out funding.</strong></p>

<p>We all recognise the importance of SMEs to our economy. There are 5.5 million of them representing 99.9% of all businesses, accounting for 16.3 million jobs (61% of the national total) and a combined turnover of around £2.3 trillion (52% of the nation). When these businesses face a tough time, the livelihoods of millions of people are at stake as is the UK’s economic health. This is why we all – funders and their advisors - need to ensure that they have a finance strategy in place to support their businesses in good times and in bad.</p>

<p>Finance strategies need to take a long-term view. During the pandemic, businesses benefited from the Government support measures in the form of loans but also a reduction in expenses such as rates relief whilst also having the option of putting back HMRC payments.

		<slug><![CDATA[commercial-loans-here-for-the-long-haul]]></slug>
		<published><![CDATA[2022-02-04 11:45:03]]></published>
		<updated><![CDATA[2022-02-04 11:45:03]]></updated>
		<content><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>Sharon Bryden, Director of&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>Commercial Loans</em></strong><strong><em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</em></strong><a href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/asset-based-lending"><strong><em>Asset Based Lending</em></strong><strong><em>&nbsp;at Time Finance</em></strong></a><strong><em>, explains why it’s essential UK businesses now need to move away from those short-term solutions and focus on funding options that are here for the long haul.</em></strong></p>

<p>In 2020, many firms were forced into survival mode and turned to Government funding solutions to react quickly to their fluctuations in business income. Fast forward to 2021 and the success of the UK’s vaccine programme provided an injection of stability into the market, resulting in business owners looking more optimistically towards the future.</p>

<p>As business markets increasingly return to pre pandemic levels, many firms will be experiencing markets which have adapted and they will need to review how they intend to compete to stay ahead of the curve. Planning for the long-term future will help them to develop answers to the questions they may have – what impact they want to make and how they want to be positioned to service their markets. Questions they have probably been unable to focus on for some time now…</p>

<p>Funding partners play an essential role in guiding business owners in the right direction. Understanding what it is they want to achieve, sourcing the right funding solution to support those long-term plans and delivering it at the right time is crucial.</p>

<p><a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/loans" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Commercial Loans</a> are a sensible funding solution for supporting future growth plans. Their flexibility and certainty puts SMEs in the driving seat. They provide a long-term cashflow boost which helps firms to take advantage of new opportunities. Commericial Loans can be used to support ambitious growth plans from improving product ranges, recruiting talent, and introducing new skills to investing in machinery or property.</p>

<p>It’s crucial that UK businesses have the financial freedom to take on those opportunities with confidence. At <a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time Finance</a>, we doubled the amount of funding available to UK businesses through our Secured Loans to £500,000 because we recognize that opportunities can often come at a cost. We want to provide the peace of mind that funding support is available.</p>

<p>We recently supported a haulage and distribution firm who had an exciting opportunity to enter into a partnership with leading parcel delivery firm, DPD. Their financial advisor approached our Commercial Loan team as he recognized that the income opportunity for the firm was significant but that they would need to invest to deliver the contract. Our Commercial Loan solution gave them the confidence to purchase new vehicles and expand their fleet, recruit five new drivers and put in place an ongoing training programme to retain staff and continually develop their skills.</p>

<p><a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/loans">Commercial Loans provide the confidence firms need to look forward</a> and invest in long-term plans which is great for their businesses and the UK economy.</p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<p>Just 50% of Northern business leaders have a strategy in place to reduce their carbon footprint despite the Government’s 2050 net-zero target, according to new research by <a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time Finance</a>.</p>

<p>Businesses are one of the largest emitters of carbon in the UK. Figures from the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy estimate that in 2019 some of the greatest emissions in the UK came from the transportation sector (27%) and energy sector (21%). The journey to net zero was predicted to accelerate following the spotlight COP26 put on businesses to make a change. Despite this, just half of Northern businesses surveyed by Time Finance said that they will put in place measures to improve their green credentials, compared with 100% of Southern-based firms who will look to prioritise partnering with sustainable suppliers, investing in electric vehicles and other eco-friendly machinery over the course of the next 6 months.</p>

<p>The survey which set out to explore business efforts to go green in 2022 found that increasing concerns surrounding affordability were raised by Northern SMEs. 100% of East Midlands-based firms and almost one in five North West businesses said the cost of implementing green initiatives are deterring them from taking steps to improve their sustainability. Comparatively, business owners in the Southern and Welsh regions of the UK did not see affordability as a barrier to change.</p>

<p>The green movement doesn’t appear to be at the top of Northern firm’s agendas either, with 17% stating that they have other priorities for business investment, and almost one in five believe that they don’t have the time to take action.</p>

<p><strong>Ed Rimmer, CEO at Time Finance, commented:</strong> “Our impact on the environment dominated the headlines following COP26 and the pressure is on British businesses to act now. Achieving net zero will come as a challenge for most businesses but taking no action will come at a significant cost too.</p>

<p>“It’s worrying to see Northern businesses holding back because of lack of funding. As a national finance provider to business owners, we work hard to ensure that businesses in all regions break down the barriers holding their businesses back and bring their investment plans to life. With more affordable solutions in place, they can push this further up their business agenda.”</p>

<p>The Time Finance survey revealed that 80% of Northern firms are calling on the Government for more support to encourage green investments. 45% believe there should be more guidance available on what measures can be taken to improve their carbon footprint and what systems can be put in place to track their impact on the environment. 22% noted that there should be a skills training and investment programme to support a green economy.</p>

<p><strong>Ed continued:</strong> “Interestingly, it doesn’t just come down to funding. There appears to be a gap in knowledge, guidance and skills training available and these are acting as significant obstacles for Northern firms to overcome. To me, it is clear that moving closer to net zero is about incremental change. Business owners overcome a variety of challenges every day and for this very reason, they simply can’t give all of their time and resources to just one (albeit pressing) issue. That said, the pressure to address climate change still remains. If SMEs are to act now, they need more support from both the lending industry and the Government.”</p>

		<content><![CDATA[<p>The journey to net zero is set to accelerate in 2022 as new research from <a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time Finance</a> reveals that business leaders are planning to implement strategies to reduce their carbon footprint and improve their green credentials over the next 6 months.</p>

<p>The survey which explored business efforts to go green found that firms in the South of the UK are leading the charge, with 100% already having plans in place to reduce their carbon footprint - from partnering with sustainable suppliers to investing in electric vehicles and other eco-friendly machinery cited as the main areas for driving change. Northern firms, on the other hand, appear to be off to a slower start with just half of business leaders in this region putting their plans into place.</p>

<p>Whilst 100% of East-Midlands based businesses and one in five North West firms told Time Finance that the cost of implementing green initiatives is deterring them from taking steps to improve their sustainability, business owners in the Southern and Welsh regions of the UK said that they did not see affordability as a barrier to change.</p>

<p><strong>Ed Rimmer, CEO at Time Finance, commented:</strong> “Our impact on the environment dominated the headlines following COP26 and the pressure is on British businesses to act now. It’s fantastic to see those already taking steps to reduce their carbon footprint.</p>

<p>“That said, there appears to be a considerable difference between northern and southern businesses and the progress they are making with their efforts to go green. As a national funder, we want to ensure that every business regardless of location, breaks down those barriers and can bring their investment plans to life. Our findings indicate that for particularly those in the North working capital, encouragement and confidence to invest in more sustainable practices is needed.”</p>

<p>In the survey Southern firms joined those in the Northern regions to call on the Government for more support. 45% believe there should be more guidance available on what measures can be taken to improve their carbon footprint and what systems can be put in place to track their impact on the environment. 22% noted that there should be a skills training and investment programme to support a green economy.</p>

<p><strong>Ed continued:</strong> “Interestingly, both the North and South report and recognise there to be a gap in knowledge, guidance and skills training available. To me, it is clear that moving closer to net zero is about incremental change. Business owners overcome a variety of challenges every day and for this very reason, they simply can’t give all of their time and resources to just one (albeit pressing) issue.

		<content><![CDATA[<p>The UK’s North and South divide continues to widen as businesses begin their journey on the road to Net Zero, according to new findings from <a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time Finance</a>.</p>

<p>Exploring business efforts to “Go Green” in the New Year, the alternative finance provider found that whilst 70% of the UK business owners surveyed have already implemented measures to become more sustainable (from partnering with sustainable suppliers to investing in electric vehicles and other eco-friendly machinery), the findings paint a concerning picture of regional challenges and setbacks.</p>

<p>Firms based in central and northern regions of the UK reported concerns surrounding the affordability of making sustainable investments, with 100% of East Midlands-based firms and almost 1 in 5 North West firms surveyed reporting that the cost of implementing green initiatives is deterring them from taking steps to improve their sustainability. Comparatively, business owners in the Southern and Welsh regions of the UK did not see affordability as a barrier to change.</p>

<p>As a result, only 20% of northern-based firms will consider green investments, such as resources, equipment and training, over the next 6 months compared with 100% of South East, South West and Welsh regions who will. Half of those businesses will use existing cashflow to finance their sustainability plans, 1 in 4 will use their existing bank provider, and 1 in 4 will turn to an alternative finance provider.</p>

<p><strong>Ed Rimmer, CEO at Time Finance, commented:</strong> “Our impact on the environment dominated the headlines following COP26 and the pressure is on British businesses to act now. For those already taking steps to reduce their carbon footprint, it refocused their attention and for those that were yet to embark on environmental initiatives, the road to net zero was being paved out for them. What we can see in our survey is that for many intent is there, but SMEs, many of which are still in post-pandemic recovery, are facing a lack of capital, encouragement and confidence to invest in more sustainable practices.</p>

<p>“There appears to be a considerable difference between businesses in the North and South and the progress they are making with their efforts to go green. As a national funder, we want to ensure that every business regardless of location, breaks down those barriers and can bring whatever their investment plans are to life.”</p>

<p>Overall, 2 in 3 SMEs don’t think there is enough Government support to help support the adoption of green initiatives. 45% believe there should be more guidance available on what measures can be taken to improve their carbon footprint and what systems can be put in place to track a business’ impact on the environment. 22% noted that there should be a skills training and investment programme to support a green economy.</p>

<p><strong>Ed continued:</strong> “Interestingly, it doesn’t just come down to funding. There appears to be a gap in knowledge, guidance and skills training available. To me it is clear that moving closer to net zero is about incremental change.

		<published><![CDATA[2022-02-08 20:02:46]]></published>
		<updated><![CDATA[2022-02-08 20:02:46]]></updated>
		<content><![CDATA[<p align="center" style="text-align: left;">2022 is set to be a transformative year for businesses with innovation, recovery and prosperity at the forefront. We don’t expect the next 12 months to come without its challenges, but we anticipate that the continued rise and evolution of <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Invoice Finance</a> will only serve to bolster business growth. Looking to the year ahead, Phil Chesham predicts what business owners will be looking out for over the next 12 months and how vital Invoice Finance will be in supporting this.</p>

<p align="center">
	<br>
</p>

<p><strong>A new year means new opportunities</strong></p>

<p>As the dust settles on 2021 and we start a new year, many businesses will see this as a chance to review, reset, and reinvest. New opportunities come in all shapes and sizes, whether that’s through innovating existing offerings, entering new markets, investing, or expanding. We know too well that with any new business venture comes strategic planning, cashflow forecasting and budgeting - because whilst grasping hold of new opportunities can result in winning new business, it can also mean increased costs. The benefit of <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance">Invoice Finance</a> is not only its ability to release additional working capital to fuel those opportunities, but it naturally compliments growth with funding lines that increase as the business grows. Invoice Finance providers regularly review these funding lines to ensure that the facility provided is not only suitable for their client’s current circumstances but also their future ambitions too.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p><strong>Invoice Finance – a favorable choice amidst rising interest rates</strong></p>

<p>The news of an increase in interest rates in December was no doubt concerning for those who have relied on short-term bank funding to bolster their finances. With interest rates likely to rise again throughout 2022, what this creates for many is a situation where more is paid back in interest than the loan or funding line itself. Changes of this nature further amplify the importance of preparing cashflow forecasts and the need to build in headroom to cover eventualities such as the rise in the cost of borrowing. The good news is that there are plenty of affordable funding options out there, and Invoice Finance is one of them that typically charges lower rates of interest than the banks. So, with further interest rate increases looming, a greater emphasis on researching available funding options and how the costs compare will not doubt be at the forefront of business owners’ minds this year. Invoice Finance will undoubtably have an important role to pay here in providing additional headroom and peace of mind.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p><strong>Zombie firms will cease to walk among us</strong></p>

<p>Over the last 18 months, thousands of businesses have been helped by Government support initiatives. So much so that the Insolvency Service statistics for Q4 showed that the total number of company insolvencies dropped to their lowest annual level in 2020 since 1989. With the final raft of support measures nearing their end and repayments now due, so-called “zombie firms” who continue to walk among us but will inevitably fold, will no longer be propped up by this additional support. It will also be a challenging period for viable firms, and so recognising which businesses have a strong future ahead of them is key. Invoice Finance providers are in an ideal position to offer support and play an essential role in ensuring those viable businesses make it out the other side and thrive. Our relationship-driven approach means we take a step away from algorithms and really understand the story behind a business and can back their ability to make it a success.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p><strong>Sustainable investments will take center stage in 2022</strong></p>

<p>Our impact on the environment dominated the headlines following COP26 and the pressure is on British businesses to act now. Many are looking at more sustainable practices such as buying recycled resources and equipment, reducing travel or using more eco-friendly forms, switching up their supply chain to team up with more sustainable partners, and carbon-zero production targets. Our latest research with our own Invoice Finance clients confirms this, revealing that 4 in 5 business owners don’t have the systems in place to monitor their impact on the environment but 45% are planning to invest in these systems, and/or new operations, equipment or practices in the next 6 months to address this. <a href="https://timefinance.com/time-blog/invoice-finance-for-smes">Invoice Finance continues to be a top choice for business owners</a> here by relieving the pressure on cashflow and providing the financial freedom to push their investment priorities further up the agenda.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>Whatever 2022 brings, <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance">Invoice Finance</a> providers will be on hand to support business owners to navigate new challenges or grasp hold of new opportunities.</p>]]></content>

		<updated><![CDATA[2022-02-15 11:09:53]]></updated>
		<content><![CDATA[<p><strong>We recently sat down with Time Finance CEO, Ed Rimmer, in our latest 5 minute interview series to get under the skin of what makes a successful deal, what changes we need to see in the market, and what inspires Ed in business. Take a look at what he had to say:</strong></p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h4>In your view, what are the key elements to a successful deal?</h4>

<p>Being easy to deal with, ensuring the deal gets done quickly and efficiently is key but transparency, communication, and trust are the foundations that achieve this.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h4>What advice do you have for the modern commercial broker?</h4>

<p>Understanding what funders want in terms of the type and size of deal and delivering prospective clients who will benefit from the solutions they offer. It sounds obvious but it’s really important to ensure all communications are open and transparent. A funder needs to see the whole picture if they are to support a business. Don’t shy away from bringing challenging issues to the table. If a funder can deliver a solution first time round, it saves everyone a lot of time and effort.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h4>What changes do you hope to see?</h4>

<p>Probably easier to say the changes that I hope not to see… Whilst I absolutely agree with flexible working if it suits the business, I challenge whether most people can be as productive from home. Thinking ‘productivity’ is about sitting at a desk churning out emails or Zoom meetings ignores the benefits a physical presence has on shaping cultural development, human interaction, influencing, guidance, leadership and most importantly, having some fun! If we’re not careful, we could have a generation of young people who miss out on some very important things that could determine their future.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h4>Which person has inspired you the most?</h4>

<p>My dad. He was a fireman for 30 years whilst running his own haulage business as a second job – something that was commonplace back then. His ‘spare time’ was spent running a motorbike racing team. He also had an entrepreneurial streak.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h4>Who do you admire most and why?</h4>

<p>Anyone that’s set up their own business and given it a go, especially when others tell them it won’t work. It’s easy to find reasons not to, but much more difficult to get on and do it.</p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<p>Pressure is being felt by smaller businesses to compensate for larger corporations falling behind when it comes to reducing carbon emissions, according to new research from <a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time Finance</a>.</p>

<p>Businesses across the UK are facing mounting pressure to reduce their carbon emissions and support the UK’s net zero targets. Despite this, industry research reveals that one third of the UK’s largest firms are failing to act now*.</p>

<p>As a voice for UK business owners, Time Finance surveyed SMEs and their financial advisors to understand attitudes towards the progress made and what barriers businesses face in their mission to become more sustainable. Over one third of small firms told Time Finance they felt a duty to overcompensate for the slow change observed from larger businesses, and over half of their financial advisors agreed.</p>

<p>Examining the challenges and obstacles in their way, Time Finance found that just 3% of business owners believe there is enough support from the Government to tackle climate change. 67% think that the Government should increase grant funding for energy efficiency measures, 56% think there should be more reward incentives for investing in green initiatives and 45% believe there should be more guidance for SMEs.</p>

<p><strong>Ed Rimmer, CEO at Time Finance, commented:</strong> “100 days have now passed since COP26 and where some businesses are making great strides to reduce their carbon emissions, others are falling behind. What our survey uncovers is the depth behind what businesses are feeling on their journey to net zero. Whilst smaller firms appear to feel the weight on their shoulders as they lead the charge, it also emphasises their speed and agility when it comes to making change and this is something larger businesses need to look to, if they want to keep up with the green movement.</p>

<p>“What’s interesting is the necessary support needed that businesses signposted in our survey. Large or small, they’re looking to Government guidance and more affordable solutions to make financing this change affordable.”</p>

<p>In terms of the main challenges faced in the UK, business respondents also cited a lack of skills investment to support a green economy (22%), an issue that the International Energy Agency estimates equates to a need for 117,000 more scientists, engineers and ESG experts by the end of the decade.</p>

<p><strong>Ed continued:</strong> “The road to net zero will undoubtedly be fraught with setbacks but crucially, we are all moving in the same direction. The barriers our customers face need to be urgently addressed; SMEs account for 99.9% of the UK’s business community, and if they face obstacles to reducing their carbon footprint, that is a shared challenge that we must work together to overcome. The right support systems in place - whether that’s from Government guidance or funding support from alternative financiers like ourselves – will ensure that they have the best chance possible of reaching net zero.”</p>

<p>Time Finance specialises in the provision or arrangement of funding solutions to UK businesses seeking to access the finance they need to realise their growth plans. UK Businesses can take advantage of an extensive portfolio comprising: <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/asset-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Asset Finance</a>, <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Invoice Finance</a>, <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/loans" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Commercial Loans</a>, <a href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/property-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Property Finance</a> and <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/vehicle-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vehicle Finance</a>.

		<content><![CDATA[<p>To celebrate International Women’s Day 2022 and this year’s theme of #BreakTheBias, we wanted to spotlight the inspiring female leaders of Time Finance to celebrate their achievements and raise awareness against bias.</p>

<p>At <a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time Finance</a>, we are proud to have built a workplace where women succeed and thrive. With 60% representation on our Operating Board and 57% in the business as a whole, the knowledge and experience of our innovative, strategic and forward-thinking female leaders helps drive the success of our organisation and makes Time Finance the business it is today.</p>

<p>We spoke to some of the women within Time Finance. Here’s what they had to say about International Women’s Day 2022:</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p><img src="/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/Tanya%20Raynes.jpg" style="width: 300px;" class="fr-fic fr-dib fr-fil" data-result="success"></p>

<p><strong>Tanya Raynes, Non-Executive Chair</strong></p>

<p>“International Women’s Day is a significant day as it showcases the positive steps we have already taken to drive change as well as spotlights what more can be done to create a more inclusive and inspiring workplace. We’re certainly moving in the right direction, but there’s a long way to go.</p>

<p>I’m a firm believer that companies benefit from a diverse perspective, and this should be encouraged. At the same time, it’s crucial that women are empowered within meritocratic cultures whereby their success can be recognised by hard work and achieving excellence, not by gender.”</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p><img src="/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/Sharon%20Bryden.jpg" style="width: 300px;" class="fr-fic fr-dib fr-fil" data-result="success"></p>

<p><strong>Sharon Bryden, Director of Commercial Loans &amp; ABL</strong></p>

<p>“International Women’s Day is so inspiring - not only does it encourage us all to reflect on the great progress women make and continue to make in business, but it also celebrates those who add amazing value each day. I owe much of my success to the strong support network I’ve had around me and truly believe that by showing the younger generation of women what can be achieved in a traditionally male dominated environment can help to develop the next generation of great female leaders.”</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p><img src="/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/Lorraine%20Neyland.jpg" style="width: 300px;" class="fr-fic fr-dib fr-fil" data-result="success"></p>

<p><strong>Lorraine Neyland, Director of Risk</strong></p>

<p>“Having started my career in Risk over 32 years ago, in what was very much a man’s world, I’ve witnessed a lot of changes over the course of that time. Most notably, how rewarding it has been for women such as myself to go against the grain, climb up the ranks and have a voice at the table where important decisions are made. I want to take a moment to celebrate how much our industry has transformed over the years. Now in 2022, there are more and more women entering and thriving in this field than ever before, and it’s a pleasure to see."</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p><img src="/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/Tansy%20Cunningham.jpg" style="width: 300px;" class="fr-fic fr-dib fr-fil" data-result="success"></p>

<p><strong>Tansy Cunningham, Head of Invoice Finance Operations</strong></p>

<p>"More and more women are stepping up into leadership positions and driving positive change across our industry. International Women’s Day is a fantastic opportunity to celebrate and honour those women bringing enthusiasm, drive, and tenacity to the table. In what has been a heavily male dominated environment for many years, it’s great to see diversity and inclusivity start to move in the right direction. But, some diversity issues do remain and in some businesses women continue to be underrepresented. This is something I am passionate about driving change for and tackling."</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p><img src="/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/Sophie%20Marsh.jpg" style="width: 300px;" class="fr-fic fr-dib fr-fil" data-result="success"></p>

<p><strong>Sophie Marsh, HR Manager</strong></p>

<p>"International Women’s Day is a fantastic opportunity to celebrate the achievements of women both in the workplace and in our personal lives.</p>

<p>Time Finance prides itself in empowering women to have more control over their careers. We have invested in training, provided mentorship for high achievers, promoted women into senior leadership positions and adopted a more flexible working offering to name just a few over the last 12 months.</p>

<p>It is a privilege to work with so many influential, inspiring women and this is something that HR will continue championing from recruitment and throughout the employee journey.”</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p><img src="/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/Kate%20Brown-1.jpg" style="width: 300px;" class="fr-fic fr-dib fr-fil" data-result="success"></p>

<p><strong>Kate Brown, Senior Marketing Manager</strong></p>

<p>“International Women’s Day is an important opportunity to recognise the incredible strides women have made and continue to make, the barriers they’ve overcome and the impact they’ve made. A lot of progress has been made over the years and to see more women in leadership positions and driving positive change is truly inspiring. I’m fortunate enough to be surrounded by colleagues, friends and family who are passionate about elevating other women and helping them to reach their full potential. That’s certainly something to celebrate.”</p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time Finance</a> are proud to announce that they have been shortlisted in the "Training Scheme of the Year" category in the<a href="https://www.insidermedia.com/news/north-west/shortlist-announced-for-north-west-young-professional-awards?utm_source=northwest_newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=northwest_news_tracker&amp;utm_medium=top_story_article" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&nbsp;Insider Media Young Professionals Awards.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>In October 2021, the firm celebrated the success of their first "Talent Leadership Programme" – a scheme designed to recognise excellence from within and enhance the skills of the next generation of future business leaders.&nbsp;Over the 12 month period, a project team of forward-thinking and ambitious 25 to 35-year-olds were challenged with real-life business tasks and projects. This included:
	<br>1. Investigating and recommending new products and services to compliment Time Finance's existing portfolio of SME finance solutions
	<br>2. Launching and building and internal intranet platform to improve communications and business processes
	<br>3. Exploring and recommending the ways in which Time Finance can improve their Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Social Governance.</p>

<p>Alongside the opportunity to project manage one of the three tasks and work in a project team to support the delivery of them, an internal mentoring programme as well as private sessions with an external leadership coach were provided.</p>

<p><strong>Speaking of the nomination, HR Manager Sophie Marsh, said:</strong> "We're a firm believer that to help our employees grow and thrive with us, they need access to training, mentorship and the opportunity to take on new challenges and experiences. Our 12-month Talent Leadership Programme did just that. We're delighted to see this programme recognised in such a leading award and look forward to the awards ceremony."</p>

<p>Following graduation, Time Finance saw many of the employees who completed the scheme go on to advance in their career in such a short space of time and go on to do great things.

		<slug><![CDATA[the-sustainable-supply-chain-rising-costs-threaten-progress-for-uk-businesses]]></slug>
		<published><![CDATA[2022-03-16 10:18:56]]></published>
		<updated><![CDATA[2022-03-16 10:18:56]]></updated>
		<content><![CDATA[<p>As rising costs continue to threaten the progress UK businesses are making towards a more sustainable supply chain, Time Finance is calling for SMEs to seek financial support to keep up the momentum from COP26 and continue investing in a more sustainable future.</p>

<p>The call to action comes following <a href="https://timefinance.com/about-us">Time Finance</a>’s Going Green survey, which found that an impressive 70% of businesses across the UK already make conscious choices to employ a sustainable supply chain as part of their wider carbon reduction strategies.</p>

<p>As a voice for UK business owners, Time Finance has cautioned that this progress could be put in jeopardy as businesses grapple with global supply chain issues, increasing interest rates, soaring inflation, rising fuel costs and tax hikes.</p>

<p>Time Finance surveyed SMEs and their financial advisors to understand the steps being taken by businesses to reduce their carbon footprint. Buying from sustainable suppliers ranked second in the measures businesses are currently taking, with 70% of those surveyed already employing a sustainable supply chain. This was second to recycling waste, which is already being undertaken by 90% of businesses surveyed.</p>

<p><strong>Ed Rimmer, CEO at Time Finance, commented:</strong> “Businesses are currently facing what many will see as two quite conflicting priorities: to reduce their carbon footprint and to balance the books. Making green investments and engaging sustainable supply chains come at a cost to businesses, but they can be balanced when cashflow is managed and the right investment is sought. Our research has shown that businesses are making great strides to reduce their carbon footprints but I worry that the current landscape will make the sustainable supply chain a ‘nice-to-have’ rather than a staple priority for UK businesses.</p>

<p>“What we can see is that businesses have become much more discerning with how they spend their money; their priorities have shifted as the world moves towards a more sustainable future. They are also under pressure to dramatically reduce carbon emissions in line with the Government’s targets to become net zero by 2050. That is an achievement that will come by making necessary changes to our business models, and while we can clearly see some progress being made, it will be put at risk by rising costs.”</p>

<p>Of those surveyed, 78% stated that they believe it is important to have a green supply chain, which was also cited by 45% of respondents as being a priority for their own customers.</p>

<p><strong>Ed continued:</strong> “We are all becoming more selective with how we spend our money. When we consider consumer behaviours, there is a heavy emphasis on a business’ Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG); the majority of us make purchases with our conscience and businesses in the UK have a duty to respond to that. This consumer pressure will be powerful in ensuring we continue to move in the right direction, but right now UK businesses need stability and affordability within their supply chain, and that unfortunately may put sustainability down the list of priorities.</p>

<p>“What our clients need to see is some solutions to the mounting pressures they face. They need the right investment support to continue their carbon reduction strategies but they also need better tax reliefs and subsidies that reward their efforts to go green. Without this, I worry that their efforts will wane and if that happens, we will lose the momentum we have seen since COP26 last October.”</p>

<p>Time Finance specialises in the provision or arrangement of funding solutions to UK businesses seeking to access the finance they need to realise their growth plans. UK Businesses can take advantage of an extensive portfolio comprising: <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/asset-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Asset Finance</a>, <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Invoice Finance</a>, <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/loans" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Commercial Loans,</a> <a href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/property-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Property Finance</a> and <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/vehicle-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vehicle Finance</a>. As the market continues to improve, Time Finance is confident that the business is well positioned to take advantage of the opportunities that should arise over the coming months and beyond.</p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<p>Fuel duty freezes and policies to tackle labour shortages and help mobilise global supply chains are a must for this week’s Spring Statement, according to Ed Rimmer, Chief Executive of <a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time Finance</a>.</p>

<p>“Businesses and households in the UK are looking to next week’s Spring Statement with some hope that the Chancellor will announce measures to help tackle rising costs. There is a rumour that the Government will delay or reverse the planned increase to National Insurance, which would give businesses some scope to increase wages to accommodate the rising cost of living. Should this be announced, however, these will be small gains that barely scratch the surface.</p>

<p>“A lot has happened since 2021’s Autumn Budget. Inflation is at a 30-year high, interest rates are rising and fuel and energy prices are increasing alongside tax. For UK businesses, the challenges faced run far deeper than post-pandemic bounce back. We work with many businesses in manufacturing, construction, food and beverage, automotive, and farming and agriculture, and these industries have been universally affected by global supply chain disruption. These businesses need, and deserve, to know from the Government what will be done to tackle these challenges to ensure they have access to a stable and affordable supply chain.</p>

<p>“The House of Commons front benches like to remind us that the Government delivered on Brexit but what does this really mean for businesses? Labour shortages continue to plague many industries and any steps taken to plug these gaps have all been insufficient and too short-term. A long-term strategy has been severely lacking from the Government; it needs to share with businesses its plan for the future of the UK’s workforce, both in terms of its size and skills.</p>

<p>“Of course the elephant in the room for everyone across the country, and one of a few big pressure points for the Government, is the rising costs of fuel and energy which has only been further accelerated by the tragic war in Ukraine. This is going to have a widespread impact throughout 2022 but the consequences are going to be far greater than increased bills. The economy needs businesses to invest in new markets, new equipment and new skills. Without these investments, businesses cannot grow and a business that is concerned about its increased overheads may become more cautious and put their plans for growth on hold. The Government needs to address this if we are to see our economy continue to recover throughout 2022 and into 2023.”</p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time Finance</a> are pleased to announce that they have supported their client, <a href="https://www.rendit.co.uk/">Rendit</a>, with a £350,000 <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Invoice Finance</a> facility as they use the funds to fuel further innovation and growth.</p>

<p>The family-owned firm was incorporated almost 30 years ago by husband-and-wife duo, Malcolm and Sandra Kitching. Their experience in the formulation, supply and application of premised render materials and systems helped them to build a strong customer base of trades men and women across the UK. In 2005, their son James Kitching took over the role of Director and set out a renewed strategy to help modernise and digitally transform the business.</p>

<p>Over the last few years under James’ management the business has grown substantially thanks to the automated technology introduced which allows employees to track live stock levels, automate deliveries and monitor distribution in real time. The digital transformation saw the firm stay ahead of the competition and increase their market share by promoting their partnership with leading brands such as K Rend, Parex, Fassa Bortolo and Eco Rend and making purchasing quick and easy.</p>

<p>Whilst keeping up with the momentum of orders, Rendit are also forced to grapple with supply chain disruption caused by the pandemic and Brexit. They turned to their financial advisor <a href="http://www.silkstoneconsultants.co.uk/">Silkstone Consultants</a> for a working capital facility to assist with buying power from suppliers. Silkstone introduced Rendit to the Invoice Finance team at Time Finance who were able to release existing working capital, otherwise tied up in unpaid invoices and inject £350,000 back into the business.</p>

<p><strong>James Kitching, Director at Rendit, said:&nbsp;</strong>“We’re so pleased to be working with Time Finance. The funding support we’ve received has been fantastic. Not only has it provided an immediate cash injection but it has also enabled us to focus our efforts on further investment in digital transformation to support our growing customer base and explore product development so that we can look to produce and sell our own render materials.”</p>

<p><a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance">Invoice Finance</a> can help businesses like Rendit fuel innovation and growth. By releasing funds otherwise tied up in unpaid invoices, businesses are no longer held back by a lack of cashflow. With facilities ranging between £10,000 and £2.5million, Invoice Finance can help businesses of all sizes.</p>

<p><strong>Rob Walters, Business Development Manager at Time Finance, said:</strong> “Rendit is a fantastic business and one we’re delighted to work with. Packaging a facility that would give them the financial freedom to overcome current challenges in the market and grasp hold of new opportunities at the same time was key. The £350k will go a long way to support their growth plans and we look forward to seeing where the business will go next.”</p>

		<updated><![CDATA[2022-03-22 20:14:00]]></updated>
		<content><![CDATA[<p>Over the past few years businesses have mastered the art of adapting to an ever-changing landscape, and the need for financial solutions to evolve alongside them has never been more prominent. This new marketplace has etched out the path for alternative lenders to adapt their offering to meet the changing needs of its client more readily - and with the support of broker relations, UK SMEs now have access to more approachable and accessible lenders than pre-pandemic.</p>

<p>Whilst the UK’s economy is seeing a much smoother landscape where businesses’ can build a strong framework in which they can re-bloom post pandemic, the economy at large still continues to face vast and radical changes as we continue into 2022. This in mind, we have adapted <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/loans">our Secured Loan offering</a> in line with the new needs of our SME clients. By raising the limit of our commercial loans, we have doubled the funding support available to UK SMEs.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p><strong>Adapting to the Market</strong></p>

<p>Working closely with our broker network is of huge importance to us here at Time Finance. Not only do these connections enable us to reach those businesses who need us most, but by nurturing such relationships we’re able to tap into the trends and issues that affect our SME clients most.</p>

<p>Following vital broker feedback last year, we noted a striking increased demand for finance to fulfil growth ambitions and drive innovation. To keep up with the changing needs of the businesses across the country, we doubled our <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/loans" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Secured Loan</a> offering to £500,000, to make accessing finance easier.</p>

<p>Our industry knows first hand the challenges that businesses have faced in recent years. With Government support now wrapped up - and needing to be repaid - the requirement for new access to funds to meet both normal operating costs and to provide capital to build future growth has heightened. With many businesses still finding their feet after significant hits to their operations, by increasing our secured lending product we can really help to provide contingency for those firms looking to inject some much needed cash into their business.</p>

<p>Whilst <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/loans" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">commercial loans</a> have been a part of our portfolio since our inception over two decades ago, the ambition to enhance this flexible solution for businesses has been renewed.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p><strong>Investment With Security</strong></p>

<p>In a new marketplace where things are never quite as certain, taking those leaps of faith to invest in business plans or gamble on a new side venture are aspects all vital to growth, but too often sidelined in favour of continued and steady momentum. By increasing our limits, we’re making sure clients can rest easy with a wider trust in their affordability and a safer facility in which to make those much needed steps in their growth plans.</p>

<p>Brokers will know all too well that by using existing assets as collateral, clients are able to unlock higher levels of cash to be used to support a wide range of growth plans, from investing in new products, vital machinery or property, to resolving cash issues. These new funding lines at £500,000 here at <a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time Finance</a>, will simply raise the bar and potential for UK businesses and enable them to thrive in 2022.</p>

<p>As the market continues to improve, we’re confident that with the joint union of brokers and alternative lenders, UK businesses will be well positioned to take back the reins and drive their businesses in the direction of the new opportunities that will arise as quarter one draws to a close.</p>]]></content>

		<slug><![CDATA[our-reaction-to-the-2022-spring-statement]]></slug>
		<published><![CDATA[2022-03-24 10:49:20]]></published>
		<updated><![CDATA[2022-03-24 10:49:20]]></updated>
		<content><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday's Spring Statement revealed a number of promises to support businesses in the Autumn Budget later this year. Reviewing the announcements made, our CEO Ed Rimmer explains why there needs to be a focus on financial aid and support to SMEs now to ensure that they have the steps in place to increase their wage bills and in-turn help employees meet the rising cost of living.</p>

<p>For a UK business owner, the Spring Statement failed to throw a lifeline that is so desperately needed to tackle rising costs, NI and tax hikes, skills shortages and supply chain disruption. The reality is businesses need support and they need it now. Waiting until the Autumn Budget later this year will only serve to stunt economic growth which means the challenges around the cost of living will only worsen.</p>

<p>‘Creating a culture for growth’ is a necessity if we’re going to meet the OBR’s forecasts. Reforming tax credits and expanding relief for R&amp;D should really be happening now so that businesses can pick up the pace with innovation. Likewise, businesses need to be able to plan capital investments and with Super Deduction coming to an end next year, they deserve to know if and when measures will be in place to help invest in new technologies to grow and innovate. The Government has promised a lot to businesses, but six months is a long time to wait for this help to materialise.</p>

<p>For the British public, the increase to the National Insurance threshold by £3,000 to £12,750 and equalising income tax will go some way to bridge the gap as costs continue to rise, but it doesn’t tackle the root of the problem. A 2024 income tax decrease is too far down the line and will only scratch the surface of the issue.</p>

<p>With only 18% of 25-64 year olds holding a vocational qualification, the UK is clearly falling behind, made worse by the fact that UK businesses spend just half the European average on training employees. Following Brexit, our main industries have continued to suffer severe skills shortages, and this is hampering our productivity. The Government has promised that the urgent skills shortfall will be addressed in the Autumn Budget and that they will seek input from businesses in the interim period. For this process to have meaningful impact, the Government should be considering a formal consultation on skills. UK businesses shoulder the burden of our economic growth, so their voice must be heard to ensure that the industries that suffer most from a lack of a skilled workforce are supported in the right way. They have valuable insight to which the Government must listen and respond.&nbsp;</p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<p align="center" style="text-align: left;">As this year throws new challenges into the mix - from rising energy and labour costs to staff shortages, supply chain issues and rising inflation - the need for adaptation and greater flexibility from the finance industry is key. Brokers play an important role in identifying what needs to be done to help their clients to overcome challenges and unlock new potential for growth and prosperity. To uncover what the lending industry must do to keep up the momentum and harness change, we sat down with some of our intermediary partners to hear what they had to say:</p>

<h4><strong>“It's all about funding for future growth”</strong></h4>

<p>Businesses are making bold decisions this year to innovate and evolve. Sustainable investments, AI and digital transformation are set to become some of the biggest market trends of 2022 and making more funding accessible to support these plans is essential. Whether it’s supporting the one-man band, the small and fast-growing team, or the well-established firm, funders need to adapt their mindset and look to the future to support those big ideas that are coming our way.</p>

<h4><strong>“Time to get creative with credit appetite”</strong></h4>

<p>It’s time for vanilla lenders to keep up with the pace of change. Brokers are calling on the lending industry to become more open-minded about the business proposals that come their way. Every business comes with its story and by listening to what that narrative is and embracing its quirkiness will help to better serve the businesses of our future.</p>

<h4><strong>“Put more options on the table”</strong></h4>

<p>As the old age saying goes, one size doesn’t fit all. We shouldn’t underestimate the importance of offering a greater choice to business owners or offering the flexibility to package multiple products together to support all of their business requirements. Taking a holistic view of the clients we support - all of the challenges they face or opportunities they have available - can go a long way to accelerating their growth.</p>

<h4><strong>“A quick no is just as important as a quick yes”</strong></h4>

<p>Time is one of the greatest assets a business has, so why take this away from them by unnecessarily prolonging a decision? Being quick on our feet and reactive means that businesses don’t miss money-making opportunities and can progress with their plans swiftly. It might not always be good news, but an honest conversation with a broker and their client can help them to understand where they sit in the market and what direction to go in next.</p>

<h4><strong>“People want to work with people”&nbsp;</strong></h4>

<p>Whilst technology advancements are inevitably shaping the future of the finance industry, ultimately people just want to work with people. Reliability, accessibility and relationship-driven are some of the greatest qualities a lender can offer a broker and their client. Partner this with a seamless service and AI that will inform data and decisions, and you will gain much more in value and loyalty from brokers and clients.</p>

<p>Times are certainly changing and conversations with our intermediary partners confirm just that. Time Finance are well equipped to keep up with the momentum of change with a broad portfolio of funding solutions which are regularly enhanced and improved to support the modern broker and business.</p>]]></content>

		<updated><![CDATA[2022-04-01 21:48:00]]></updated>
		<content><![CDATA[<p>Against the backdrop of one of the most turbulent and challenging periods for UK businesses, many looked to last week’s Spring Statement in the hopes that the Government would announce pro-active measures that would help firms grapple with rising costs, National Insurance and tax hikes, skills shortages, soaring energy and fuel prices, and ongoing supply chain disruption. Ed Rimmer tells <a href="https://www.leasinglife.com/analysis/blogs/spring-statement-was-missing-more-financial-aid-for-smes/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Leasing Life&nbsp;</a>magazine why now is the time for the alternative finance industry to really step up and provide headroom for growth:</p>

<p>"Those immediate measures introduced, including fuel duty cuts, an increase to the National Insurance threshold and the longer-term aim to cut the basic rate of income tax, will go some way to bridge the gap for consumers as bills rise. Whilst they come as welcome measures that give the population some form of relief, they fail to tackle the root of the issue and put in place a long-term solution to re-grow our economy. UK SMEs need to be at the centre of that support.</p>

<p>Small businesses make up 99% of the UK’s wealth, generating new forms of income, creating opportunities for employment and skills development, as well as driving innovation and change. Last week’s Spring Statement needed to see more financial aid directed towards businesses to ensure not only that they have the mechanisms in place to tackle their own ‘cost of doing business’ crisis but they can also meet the increase in wages their employees so desperately need. Without this, households will continue to face a financial squeeze and the ripple effect this will have across the UK will continue.</p>

<p>Our industry knows too well that when businesses are held back or worse - forced to fold due to lack of financial support - this will only serve to stunt economic growth further. It’s a continuous cycle that will snowball if not addressed quickly. ‘Creating a culture for growth’ is a necessity if we’re going to meet the OBR’s forecasts. Even then, the UK will not experience as large a period of growth as previously predicted, further amplifying the importance of backing British businesses now and putting the right measures in place.</p>

<p>The Government has promised a lot to SMEs, but with much of this yet to be announced in the Autumn Budget, six months is too long to wait for this help to materialise. Reforming tax credits and expanding relief for R&amp;D should really be happening now so that businesses can pick up the pace with innovation. Likewise, businesses need to be able to plan capital investments and with Super Deduction coming to an end next year, they deserve to know if and when measures will be in place to help invest in new technologies.</p>

<p>Businesses will be heavily reliant on support from traditional forms of lending and alternative finance solutions. This is where our industry can really step up to deliver financial aid and headroom where possible. Identifying challenges and seeking opportunities swiftly can mean the difference between success and failure in this climate. The coming months will continue to prove to be difficult, but with the right support available, what may feel like a catastrophe can turn into just a few bumps in the road. We’ll certainly be on hand to champion businesses during this time and encourage the rest of the industry to do so too.”</p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time Finance</a> are delighted to announce that they have been awarded joint first place in Business Money’s 25<sup>th</sup> Receivables review of the Invoice Finance sector. The annual Receivable Intermediaries Index recognises and celebrates the leading providers who deliver all-round service excellence to their clients, from onboarding through to appraisal, relationship management and retention.</p>

<p>In partnership with the National Association of Commercial Finance Brokers (NACFB), Business Money surveyed UK introducers – from financial advisors, to brokers and accountants – to rank a total of 47 UK based Invoice Finance providers. Time Finance and eCapital Commercial Finance (formerly Advantedge) were awarded first place, followed by Close Invoice Finance in third place.</p>

<p><strong>Phil Chesham, Head of Invoice Finance, said:</strong> “This is a fantastic and very well-deserved achievement for our team. It’s testament to the commitment of the people we have here who are passionate about supporting our clients and making a real difference to their success.”</p>

<p>Time Finance have been delivering <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Invoice Finance</a> solutions for over 15 years. During that time, they have supported businesses from all corners of the UK and assisted a wide range of growth plans from investment to expansion, mergers and acquisitions as well as resolving cashflow issues.</p>

<p><strong>Norman Chambers, CEO of the NACFB commented:</strong> “The NACFB liaises closely with Business Money: our nationwide membership is highly professional and works with finance houses and other professionals to deliver carefully tailored solutions for businesses finance needs.</p>

<p>We operate under a strict code of conduct and Business Money’s Intermediary Index, launched in 2012, monitors the services provided by invoice financiers to our members and their clients. Last year our members sourced £41bn of new finance facilities of which invoice finance played a substantial part.</p>

<p>As the Business Money report shows, our members monitor a lender’s ongoing service, well after the deal has been completed. Relationships are paramount in commercial finance.”</p>

<p><strong>Phil continued:</strong> “Our priority is and always will be building strong relationships with our clients. This starts with understanding the background behind the business, the director’s vision for the future and how we can work together to spot opportunities and overcome challenges. It’s no surprise that our highest score was achieved in delivering excellent customer service levels. Our teams are easy to deal with and have a common-sense approach to doing business which is why our average client lifespan sits at 5 years. That’s 2 years greater than the industry average*.</p>

<p>"We know that our solutions play an important role in helping businesses to rebuild the economy and we are committed to delivering robust funding solutions to these firms that inspire confidence and growth. We have ambitious plans to drive change in the market and lead the way as we provide more support for SMEs.”</p>

<p>Alongside funding facilities ranging from £10k to £2.5m, Time Finance offer complementary services to their Invoice Finance solution. Their XTRA Time facilities help clients to access additional funding on top of their existing facility, not only to boost cashflow and provide peace of mind that extra funding support is available whenever they may need it. Time Finance’s optional Selective Bad Debt Protection product mitigates the risk of bad debts and allows clients to pick and choose which customer they want to cover.</p>

		<title><![CDATA[Invoice Finance: a no brainer for businesses looking to balance cashflow with growth]]></title>

		<published><![CDATA[2022-04-09 12:39:22]]></published>
		<updated><![CDATA[2022-04-09 12:39:22]]></updated>
		<content><![CDATA[<p>Over the next six months, we’re expecting to see more and more SMEs turning to finance to support their cashflow. The current economic challenges will only amplify this need with global supply chain issues, rising interest rates, soaring inflation, fuel costs and upcoming tax hikes all posing as threats to the good progress businesses have made over the last 12 months.</p>

<p>Our research continues to reveal that a lack of working capital is one the greatest barriers to growth that a business can face. In fact, more than one in three UK business owners believe that access to finance will help them to take on and overcome the economic challenges 2022 continues to throw at them.</p>

<p>In a recent poll*, over 50% of the financial advisors and accountants we spoke to spotlighted <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance">Invoice Finance</a> as a solution their B2B clients would likely turn to this year to release working capital, overcome challenges and grasp hold of new opportunities. But what makes Invoice Finance a such staple and popular solution in a time of economic turbulence?</p>

<p>According to our existing client base, 73% turn to Invoice Finance solutions to not only improve cashflow but to ensure that their employees, suppliers, HMRC and other financial commitments are paid on time. More than two in three told <a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time Finance</a> that their Invoice Finance facility provides them with peace of mind and more financial freedom. Over half find this to be a more flexible solution than a bank facility, with the ability to increase or lower funding limits depending on their current and future plans.</p>

<p>The benefits don’t just stop there. A good funder and financial advisor will ensure that their clients have a finance strategy in place to support their business when times get tough. Finance strategies need to take a holistic view – taking into consideration the firm’s history, current financial commitments as well as future growth plans. At Time Finance, we do just that.</p>

<p>The burden of paying back loans taken out during the pandemic is a reality many businesses are facing, but this seems to be shadowed by current market challenges. It was only two months ago when 35% of businesses said one of their greatest concerns was the ability to pay these funds back. One in five of our existing client base said that working with an Invoice Finance provider has made financial forecasting easier, and 73% said that as a result they feel confident that their lender has a good understanding of their business and the challenges they will face through 2022.</p>

<p>But, it's not all about preparing for bumps in the road and building up cash reserves. A cautious approach might be sensible, but it can also risk leaving businesses trailing behind the competition. In fact, over one in three clients tell Time Finance that they take advantage of Invoice Finance to support their investment and expansion plans. Over the next six months and with financial support in place, 45% will look to invest in sustainable systems, operations, equipment and practices that strengthen their green agenda, whilst one in three will look to invest in fresh talent.</p>

<p><a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance">Invoice Finance</a> continues to grow in popularity because of its personal approach to providing finance. Benefiting from a dedicated relationship manager and access to decision makers means business owners can ensure that money-making opportunities aren’t missed and decisions can be made swiftly. So much so, that 91% of clients rank a relationship-driven approach as the most important thing they look for in a funder, compared with just 64% who rank affordability high up in their wish list.</p>

<p>There’s no doubt that those clients who already benefit from Invoice Finance do so because it relieves the pressure on their cashflow and gives them the financial freedom to grow and thrive, even when things get tough. But when it comes to supporting a business, of course, there are a number of other financial solutions out there that might be more appropriate to their circumstances. It’s key that those options are considered and presented to clients so that they are able to receive the right funding support from the outset. This is one of the core reasons why Time Finance offer a broad portfolio of solutions – from <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/asset-finance">Asset Finance</a>, to <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Invoice Finance</a>, <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/loans" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Commercial Loans</a>, <a href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/property-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Property Finance</a> and <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/vehicle-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vehicle Finance</a>. It means that despite the challenges or opportunities lying ahead, we can help.</p>

		<updated><![CDATA[2022-04-11 07:37:10]]></updated>
		<content><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://timefinance.com/">Time Finance</a> are pleased to announce continued expansion in their Invoice Finance team with Louise Williams’ appointment as Business Development Manager.</p>

<p>Louise joins Time Finance with over 20 years’ experience in the financial services sector. She started her career with Lloyds Banking Group in risk before moving into sales and working her way up the ranks to become a Regional Sales Manager. After 15 years with Lloyds, she moved on to Allianz Trade (at the time Euler Hermes) before taking on a Business Development role more recently at Praetura Invoice Finance.</p>

<p>In her new position, Louise will be responsible for maintaining strong relationships with her introducer network in the North West of England and generating awareness of the funding solutions available to business owners through Time Finance – from<a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Invoice Finance</a> to <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/asset-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Asset Finance</a>, <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/loans" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Commercial Loans</a>, <a href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/property-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Property Finance</a> and <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/vehicle-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vehicle Finance</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Speaking of her appointment, Louise said:&nbsp;</strong>"I’m really excited to be joining Time Finance, who have an excellent reputation for delivering flexible and stable solutions that help businesses grow and prosper. I look forward to working with the team and building on their success.”</p>

<p>Invoice Finance can relieve pressure on cashflow and give businesses the freedom to grow. By releasing up to 90% of the value of unpaid invoices, business owners can access additional working capital and use the funds to support day-to-day cashflow requirements or support innovation and growth. Time Finance offer confidential and disclosed facilities ranging from £10,000 to £2.5million, with the added flexibility that their facilities can grow alongside a business.</p>

<p><strong>Andy Hume, Head of Sales at Time Finance, added:</strong> “Louise’s appointment comes at an important time with current economic challenges leaving many firms short of cash and in need of our financial support. With a national sales team, we are in a strong position to continue delivering valuable and staple finance solutions to more businesses who are looking to release additional working capital for innovation and growth.</p>

<p>With Louise’s experience and can-do attitude, I’m confident that she will be a great addition to our team. I’m delighted to have her on board.”</p>

<p>Louise’s recruitment is the latest in a string of appointments at Time Finance in recent months. <a href="https://timefinance.com/press-releases/an-asset-to-the-team-time-finance-appoint-steve-nichols-as-director-of-asset-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Steve Nichols</a> stepped up as Director of Asset Finance, whilst <a href="https://timefinance.com/press-releases/david-nurcombe-appointed-as-business-development-manager-at-time-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">David Nurcombe</a> and <a href="https://timefinance.com/press-releases/michael-freebury-joins-time-finance-to-drive-business-growth-in-wales" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Michael Freebury</a> joined the Invoice Finance team to bolster their presence in the South East, South West and Wales regions.</p>]]></content>

</p>

<p>Global fitness brand, <a href="https://www.hitiogym.com/">HITIO Gym</a>, are excited to announce they have launched their second UK site thanks to funding support from <a href="https://timefinance.com/">Time Finance</a>.</p>

<p>The unique fitness franchise was founded in 1998 and soon became one of the largest fitness chains in Norway, with 50 clubs nationwide. HITIO Gym’s distinctive offering brings people together through physical activity with a broad range of facilities and classes as well as allowing families with children to exercise at the same time. The universal popularity of the concept has allowed the firm to later expand into other countries such as Sweden, Portugal and the UK.</p>

<p>Husband and wife duo, Raj and Manisha Nagpal, were excited to take on the challenge of opening the UK’s second HITIO Gym site in Orpington and making fitness an activity the whole family could get involved in. They turned to leading alternative finance provider, Time Finance, for support in securing £300,000 worth of gym equipment and furniture.</p>

<p>Through Time Finance’s <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/asset-finance">Asset Finance</a> solutions, Raj and Manisha were able to source the items they needed whilst at the same time maintaining a positive cashflow and keeping capital within the business. HITIO Gym celebrated the launch of their new Orpington site in January of this year.</p>

<p><strong>Matt Sturney, Senior Sales Manager at Time Finance, said:</strong> “I’m so pleased to have helped Raj and Manisha on what is a fantastic business venture for them. HITIO’s unique offering certainly sets them apart from other fitness chains on the market right now, and I have no doubt we’ll see more franchises opening up across the UK in the near future.”</p>

<p>Asset Finance can help businesses like HITIO Gym to bring their investment plans to life. By spreading the cost of investment into manageable and affordable payments, businesses can grow with confidence and no longer feel held back by a lack of available working capital.</p>

<p><strong>Manisha Nagpal, Co-Director at HITIO Gym in Orpington, said:&nbsp;</strong>“We’ve known Matt for over 10 years now and he has supported us with a number of our business ventures. The team at Time Finance knew exactly what we were looking for and were able to pull together a package which helped us secure all the equipment we needed but also put in place supportive financing options to keep a healthy flow of cash in the business. The whole process has been nothing short of fantastic!”</p>

<p>Their funder Time Finance specialise in the provision or arrangement of funding solutions to UK businesses seeking to access the finance they need to realise their growth plans. With an extensive portfolio comprising: <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/asset-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Asset Finance</a>, <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Invoice Finance</a>,<a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/loans" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&nbsp;Loans</a> and <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/vehicle-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vehicle Finance</a> on offer, businesses have the flexibility to choose the best option for them or to choose more than one solution dependent on requirement.</p>

		<content><![CDATA[<p><img src="/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/esme-french-kate-brown-1medium.jpg" class="fr-fic fr-dib" data-result="success" style="width: 100%;"></p>

<p>Aspiring marketer, Esme French, recently joined our Manchester office for a Marketing Internship. Working alongside our Senior Marketing Manager, Kate Brown, Esme has been able to spend the last few weeks gaining an invaluable insight into the world of marketing and financial services as well as connecting with key people in our organisation and expanding her network. We spoke to Esme to understand how the Marketing Internship has benefited her.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p><strong>1. How would you describe your work experience placement at Time Finance?</strong></p>

<p>It has been amazing. I have loved being able to have a very hands-on approach with all aspects of their marketing strategy while shadowing Kate Brown, their Senior Marketing Manager. Throughout my experience, Kate has been a brilliant mentor to me. She’s given me advice, explained each area of their marketing strategy, helped me to understand the company and teach me things about marketing I wasn’t aware of. The whole experience has been very valuable to me and will help me progress my career as a marketer.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p><strong>2. What was your favourite thing about working here?</strong></p>

<p>What I most enjoyed was being able to see how their marketing strategy is defined and implemented. From an outside perspective, I was very impressed by their marketing activities and strength of the brand, but to gain a unique insight into how this is formed was particularly interesting.</p>

<p>I’ve also found the working environment to be friendly, welcoming and supportive. Every colleague has made me feel like a valued member of the team and I will be sad to leave.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p><strong>3. How would you describe Time Finance to others?</strong></p>

<p>Despite them having over 150 employees, it really felt like a dedicated and close-knit team of employees who all support each other through their careers. Overall, I can see that Time Finance is a rewarding company to work for. Not only does it offer a lovely workplace environment for employees but by offering financial services and solutions it helps businesses to thrive which is lovely to see.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p><strong>4. What new skills or techniques have you learnt during your placement?</strong></p>

<p>Completing this work experience has helped me gain important skills that are transferrable across all areas of marketing. I have learnt how to effectively target key audiences through email marketing on Mailchimp, plan and schedule paid and organic social media posts, uncover SEO tactics, upload a continuous flow of dynamic content to a website, conduct detailed competitor analysis, produce creative design work, learn how to effectively partner with agencies, and finally, measure success through analytics.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p><strong>5. How has it changed your perception of starting your career in marketing?</strong></p>

<p>I now realise I want to begin my marketing career as soon as possible. I think it was very valuable for me to be able to have a hands-on approach with multiple areas of marketing and experience what kind of working environment I would best thrive in. It has definitely encouraged me to start the next phase of my career in digital marketing – particularly in the paid media area of marketing. I feel so motivated to begin!</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p><strong>6. Would you recommend graduate / training schemes or internships to other young professionals looking to kickstart their careers?</strong></p>

<p>I would definitely recommend any form of training scheme or internship to any young professional looking to progress their career. Personally, I have found completing my marketing internship as one of the most eye opening and valuable things I have done. Not only have I been able to apply the skills I’ve previously learnt, but I’ve been able to build on these further and expand my knowledge.</p>

<p>This internship has helped me to further define what I want for my career path at such a crucial stage in my life. Any experience that can help you gain important transferrable skills and give you an insight into the working world, is worth doing!</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p><strong>7. Why do you think internships are so important for professional development?</strong></p>

<p>I think internships are important for professional development because of the networks and connections you can build around you. You can quite quickly learn from others – whether it’s from their experience in the working world and how to behave in a professional environment as well as how to prepare for your future job role. They give you an insight into the working world you won’t be able to receive from anywhere else.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p><strong>8. What do you think the most valuable part of having a mentor is?</strong></p>

<p>The most valuable part of having a mentor is being able to benefit, learn from and turn to someone who is willing to help you excel in your career. From my experiences so far, I’ve learnt that a great mentor will have your best intentions at heart when offering advice and helping you. Kate has personally helped me to learn about areas of marketing I wasn’t already familiar with whilst providing careers guidance, helping me to build my network and meet new people, whilst showing me all that Manchester has to offer.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p><strong>9. What advice would you give other young professionals who are looking to gain experience?</strong></p>

<p>Put yourself out there and do it. Any form of internship or training will most certainly benefit you in the future, whether that’s for your personal or professional development. You’re able to gain skills that can’t be attained anywhere else and it will solidify your goals for the future.</p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time Finance</a> are delighted to announce that Kate Brown has taken up a new role within the firm as Head of Marketing. The move sees her promoted from her previous position as Senior Marketing Manager to oversee the creation and delivery of the marketing strategy for Time Finance.</p>

<p>Kate brings over 5 years’ experience to the role, having built a credible career as an ambitious marketer within the financial services sector. Most notably, in 2020 she supported the delivery of Time Finance’s rebrand from the AIM-listed group of businesses formerly known as the 1pm plc Group. In her new role as Head of Marketing, she will lead a compelling strategy across brand, PR and digital marketing as well as expand the team to bring in more specialists that share her vision in driving innovation and change within marketing.</p>

<p><strong>Speaking of her appointment, Kate said:&nbsp;</strong>“I’m honoured to be stepping up to the Head of Marketing role at Time Finance and leading our marketing function. As an ambitious and forward-thinking business, the Time Finance brand is one I’m immensely proud to help shape and grow. Whilst the last few years has seen the firm establish itself as a recognisable force in the market, we have very exciting plans to invest in and accelerate our brand further.”</p>

<p>Time Finance provides the funding support businesses need to help bring their ambitions to life – whether that’s through innovation, investment, or expansion.

Since its launch in 1998, Time Finance has grown rapidly providing and arranging £116million of funding annually to UK businesses to support their growth plans.</p>

<p><strong>Ed Rimmer, CEO at Time Finance, commented:</strong> “Kate has done a great job since joining Time Finance 3 years ago and has played an instrumental role in driving our marketing strategy and generating brand awareness within that time. One of our greatest objectives is positioning ourselves firmly in front of business owners as they continue to recover and look for forward-thinking and supportive funders to accelerate their growth plans. As an alternative finance provider, we are the ideal funding partner to help them on that journey. I am confident that with Kate leading our marketing function we will achieve this.”</p>]]></content>

<p>Laura joins the leading alternative finance provider with over 14 years of experience. Laura began her career at Syscap in account and relationship management positions prior to its acquisition by Wesleyan in 2015 where she worked directly with SMEs to understand their funding requirements and package facilities to support their investment and growth plans. She then moved into the role of Affinity and PII Broker Manager where she managed some of their key strategic relationships and specialist brokers.

She will manage Time Finance’s national team of Broker Managers to deliver a market-leading service to both brokers and their SME clients.</p>

<p>The announcement follows a number of recent appointments and promotions within Time Finance, including Steve Nichols to Director of Asset Finance earlier this year and Kate Brown to Head of Marketing, further demonstrating the firm’s commitment to investing in their people as well as delivering a broad solution to UK SMEs.</p>

<p><strong>Steve Nichols at Time Finance commented:</strong> “Laura is an excellent addition to the business. She brings invaluable experience that will help develop our broker offering as we continue to strengthen our proposition in hard and soft asset by offering quick, sensible decisions and market leading service.”</p>

		<content><![CDATA[<p>In a business landscape that’s becoming increasingly preoccupied with increasing costs and challenges to remain competitive, investment in upskilling staff and an attention to employee satisfaction is something that firms should be putting to the top of their priority list.</p>

<p>This Learning at Work Week, Chief Executive Officer at <a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time Finance</a>, Ed Rimmer, shares his thoughts on how businesses can benefit from a long-term strategy centred around investment in staff and the value of developing talent from within.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p><strong>Why do you think creating learning opportunities for employees from within can play such a crucial role in supporting a business’ success?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>At the heart of every thriving business is its staff, those who keep the cogs turning and dedicate their careers to their work. More often than not, businesses can stride forward in their growth plans and unknowingly neglect team development. Admittedly, businesses do have many plates to spin however, if they can devote time to employee wellbeing and learning, they can in turn help to solve the challenges faced as their industries continue to adapt.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When an industry is flipped on its head, as many felt during the pandemic, it requires agile thinking and this is where new skills are vital. Businesses can of course pay the necessary recruitment fees and fill their skills gap with new talent. But, better than this, they can develop their teams from within and not only meet their skills gap but provide progression opportunities and job satisfaction for current employees along the way. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>It’s a no brainer for businesses of all sizes to provide ongoing learning opportunities and career advancements for their employees. Not only does a business save money on recruitment fees and training costs, but with staff retention comes a deeper understanding of the business and in this environment, firms are really able to flourish, whilst time and effort can also be minimised.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p><strong>In which ways do you believe businesses most benefit from investing in training and employment schemes?</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It goes without saying that when a company invests in training and employment, it's with team development in mind. That said, there are countless benefits to a company’s development that come alongside this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Investing in your team benefits everything from boosting a company’s reputation, increasing its staff retention, and fuelling employee performance, to training future leaders and encouraging loyalty. A company can build a team that works together to drive the business forward by taking small steps along the way.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p><strong>In your view, what are the most effective ways businesses can upskill from within and why is this valuable to overcome recruitment challenges?</strong></p>

<p>Upskilling can come in a number of different ways - and at varying costs to a business. With free online training and knowledge sharing exercises, you can spread the expertise throughout at almost no cost to the business. &nbsp;</p>

<p>In the last few years, many businesses have moved to a hybrid or totally remote way of working, where communication is limited to just calls and emails. In these environments it’s vital that development does not falter and that all members of the team, particularly the junior members, are benefitting from contact time with senior members of staff in order to progress and widen their skill sets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Training your managers and leaders to coach their teams for development and creating new projects and opportunities is a great way to promote continual learning. With encouragement in personal development, you can create a culture for growth, both professionally, personally and for the business.</p>

<p>Where a more detailed route is necessary, you can work with learning partners to provide course opportunities and in some cases, give access to undergraduate degrees. By doing so, you can bring back cutting edge ideas to your businesses and really make the difference between a stagnant business and a thriving one.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p><strong>Do you think there is enough being done in the UK to encourage learning at work?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Whilst learning at work is something all businesses should practice, it doesn't come without its cost. And with the immense pressure and financial turmoil that UK SMEs are currently facing, finding the funds to cover these costs will prove challenging for most.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With very little government support available to businesses to invest in skills, many are turning to financial specialists like <a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time Finance</a>. Via our funding routes: <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Invoice finance</a>, <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/asset-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Asset finance</a>, <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/loans" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Loans</a>, <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/vehicle-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vehicle finance</a> and <a href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/asset-based-lending" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Asset-Based Lending</a>, businesses can unlock funds from within, releasing additional working capital, and giving them the financial freedom to invest in its teams.</p>

<p>By unlocking such funds companies are able to stay on top of their game, provide a competitive edge and thrive in a business landscape that is thirsty for agile thinking and innovation from its businesses.</p>]]></content>

		<updated><![CDATA[2022-05-19 09:15:00]]></updated>
		<content><![CDATA[<p>According to new research conducted by <a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time Finance</a>, more than 70% of financial intermediaries believe their clients will need some form of funding support over the next 6 months to deal with and overcome the economic challenges that 2022 continues to throw at them. The findings come as many of their SME clients face supply chain issues, interest rate hikes, soaring inflation, fuel costs, and tax increases.</p>

<p>When asked what funding solution intermediaries believed would lead recovery in 2022, 88% ranked <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/loans">Commercial Loans</a> at the top of that list. This was followed closely by <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/asset-finance">Asset Finance</a> to support investment in essential pieces of business equipment, which was highlighted as a key funding option by 82% of intermediaries. Other options included relying on existing cashflow (76%), overdraft facilities (64%) and <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance">Invoice Finance</a> (59%).</p>

<p><strong>Sharon Bryden, Director of Commercial Loans &amp;&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/vehicle-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>ABL</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;at Time Finance, commented:</strong> “UK businesses are facing an incredibly challenging time and the continued rise in costs will only serve to place additional pressure on firms. Unless they’re equipped with the right form of funding support, those businesses will be forced to make some serious sacrifices to offset and manage the increased cost of doing business.</p>

<p>“Hearing from our intermediary network that Commercial Loans will form one of the most valuable funding solutions comes as no surprise. With healthy facilities available, their swift set up and easy access makes this finance option a no brainer for firms looking for a cash injection that supplies peace of mind and headroom for future growth.</p>

<p>“It’s pleasing to see other funding options such as Asset Finance and Invoice Finance not too far down that list either. At Time Finance, we have always recognised the value of offering and delivering the full spectrum of finance options to businesses to ensure that all of their needs are met. Whilst Commercial Loans appears to be the solution predicted to drive recovery, we firmly believe that these other alternative funding options will play a crucial supporting role.”</p>

<p>Time Finance work closely with financial intermediaries to support over 20,000 SMEs each year with flexible and supportive funding solutions. Their broad portfolio of solutions help business owners to access <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/asset-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Asset Finance</a>,<a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&nbsp;Invoice Finance</a>, <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/loans" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Commercial Loans,</a> <a href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/property-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Property Finance</a> and<a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/vehicle-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&nbsp;Vehicle Finance&nbsp;</a>solutions to aid their recovery and future growth plans.</p>

		<published><![CDATA[2022-05-26 09:15:00]]></published>
		<updated><![CDATA[2022-05-26 09:15:00]]></updated>
		<content><![CDATA[<p>According to new research conducted by <a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time Finance</a>, 92% of business owners believe that a relationship driven approach is the most important quality in an <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Invoice Finance&nbsp;</a>provider. The findings come as financial intermediaries anticipate an increase in demand for Invoice Finance services, with more than half expecting to introduce their business-to-business (B2B) clients to an Invoice Finance provider in the next six months.</p>

<p>In their latest survey, Time Finance investigated what companies need to help them recover and grow, as rising energy and labour costs, staff shortages, supply chain issues, and rising inflation all continue to impact UK business owners. Following a relationship-driven approach, 67% said they would prioritise working with a funder who understands their business sector and the challenges or opportunities they may face. 67% also said they would look for added flexibility to increase or decrease funding levels, whilst 58% said access to decision makers is essential.</p>

<p><strong>Phil Chesham, Head of Invoice Finance at Time Finance, commented:&nbsp;</strong>"Invoice Finance is an increasingly popular solution that has assisted businesses in overcoming challenges and identifying opportunities for growth during times of economic turbulence. A relationship-driven approach offers tailored support, access to the right people who can make decisions swiftly, and a true understanding of their business and its requirements. It’s no surprise this ranks as a top priority for business owners - this is more important than ever as recessionary predictions loom.</p>

<p>“Rising inflation, soaring operational costs, pandemic recovery measure repayments, supply chain disruption, and now interest rate hikes will sadly force many businesses into insolvency or restructuring. On the other hand, opportunities will be created for financially sound and resilient businesses. It's about understanding where a company is now and where it wants to go. I firmly believe that Invoice Finance providers are the ideal funding partner to assist businesses in charting their own course and thankfully many business owners already recognise the qualities a good funder will provide them.”</p>

<p>Of Time Finance’s existing client base, 67% told the Invoice Finance provider that their facility gives them peace of mind and helps them to better manage their cashflow. 58% highlight one of the greatest benefits to be the flexibility of their funding line growing alongside their business and 42% say it gives them the working capital needed to carry out investment and expansion plans.</p>

<p>Time Finance offer Invoice Finance facilities ranging between £10,000 and £2.5million to ensure that businesses are no longer held back by a lack of cashflow from late payments and have the financial freedom to reinvest and grow. <a href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/outsourced-credit-control">Their optional credit control service can take the strain away</a> from chasing payments and protect customer relationships.</p>

		<content><![CDATA[<p>New data from <a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time Finance</a> reveals peace of mind, flexibility and supporting cashflow to be the top three <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance">benefits of having an Invoice Finance facility</a>, according to UK business owners.</p>

<p>As well as this, 42% of UK business owners told Time Finance that Invoice Finance gives them more financial freedom, whilst one in four said it helps them to relieve valuable time wasted in chasing payments and more time to grow their business. A further 17% said they have better relationships with their customers as a result of this facility.</p>

<p>As an alternative finance solution that releases up to 90% of the value of unpaid invoices, Invoice Finance is an increasingly popular solution that helps business owners to access additional working capital and use the funds to support day-to-day cashflow requirements or support innovation and growth.</p>

<p>Industry body, UK Finance, reports that 42,000 businesses benefit from Invoice Finance in the UK. According to Time Finance's survey, this figure has the potential to rise in 2022 with over half of financial intermediaries expecting their business-to-business (B2B) clients to turn to Invoice Finance within the next six months.</p>

<p><strong>Phil Chesham, Head of Invoice Finance, at Time Finance said:</strong> "As the culture of late payment continues to rise here in the UK, the threat that this poses to businesses also grows. Our recent survey results highlight just how vital Invoice Finance is to businesses.</p>

<p>“Of the business owners surveyed, 67% reported that an Invoice Finance facility helps them to pay suppliers, HMRC, employees and other financial commitments on time. 50% told Time Finance that it helps to manage <a href="https://timefinance.com/time-blog/late-invoice-payments-what-to-do">late payments from customers</a> and over one third said it helps them to better combat the current economic challenges such as rising costs and inflation.</p>

<p>“<a href="https://timefinance.com/press-releases/late-payment-debt-as-high-as-200000-for-1-in-5-smes" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">With late payment debt as high as £200,000 for one in five UK SMEs</a>, Invoice Finance solutions are as vital as ever and with the addition of <a href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/outsourced-credit-control">our credit control service here at Time Finance</a>, we can really take the strain away from chasing payments and protect our clients' customer relationships.”</p>

<p>Time Finance offers<a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&nbsp;Invoice Finance</a> facilities ranging between £10,000 and £2.5million to ensure that businesses are no longer held back by a lack of cashflow from late payments and have the financial freedom to reinvest and grow.</p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<p>It’s no surprise that businesses are feeling more uncertain than ever. With everything that’s happening in the wider market – from rising energy costs to interest rate hikes, inflation, supply chain disruption –an astonishing 76% of SMEs and financial intermediaries are predicting that the UK will fall into a recession later this year*. For many, the outlook will only worsen if they don’t seek support soon.</p>

<p>The previous two years have taught business owners to be more resilient in times of turbulence and to act swiftly where possible. Already, we’re seeing that companies are beginning to make major sacrifices in order to combat and manage the greater cost of doing business, getting themselves as ready as they can be, for the next few difficult months. According to our research, 91 percent of business owners are increasing their own costs, with some increasing their prices by up to 30 percent. Without this cost increase, one in five businesses said that they would be unable to proceed with their investment and expansion plans, and one in ten would see their business’ outputs diminish as they saw themselves unable to supply the same number of products as before.</p>

<p>All that said, simply increasing their own prices doesn't appear to provide them with the magic bullet solution they desperately need to navigate their way out of the cost of doing business crisis. After speaking with these companies, we discovered that their primary fear was that an increase in costs would make it more difficult for them to maintain their position as a competitive option for clients. As a result, over half feared that their new business levels and turnover in 2022 would decrease.</p>

<p>In times of economic unpredictability and concern, it's our responsibility as funders and trusted advisors to maintain a high level of confidence and help keep businesses thriving. Due to the fact that SMEs account for 99 percent of our economy, it's clear to see why their survival and contribution to the larger market is essential. Growth is stifled if companies do not have access to sufficient cash or the financial flexibility necessary to cultivate innovation and develop. This not only manifests itself as companies pulling out of markets, but in certain instances the situation is far more dire, and those companies are no longer able to survive.</p>

<p>That’s why it’s vital they find the right level of funding that not only gives firms the cash injection they need, but also peace of mind. Our own research finds that, like us, financial intermediaries, predict flexible funding solutions such as <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/loans">Commercial Loans</a> will play a prominent role in leading business recovery this year.</p>

<p>In fact, when asked what funding solution business owners would likely turn to in the next 6 months, 88 per cent of financial intermediaries ranked Commercial Loans at the top of that list. This was followed closely by Asset Finance to support investment in essential pieces of business equipment, which was highlighted as a key funding option by 82 per cent of intermediaries. Other options included relying on existing cashflow, overdraft facilities and Invoice Finance.</p>

<p>There’s no doubt that those firms who already benefit from Commercial Loans do so because of the healthy facilities available, their swift set up and easy access. It makes this finance option a no brainer for firms looking for a cash injection that supplies peace of mind and headroom for future growth. But when it comes to supporting a business, of course, there are a number of other financial solutions out there that might be more appropriate for their circumstances and it’s pleasing to see the likes of Asset Finance and Invoice Finance not too far down that list.</p>

<p>It’s important that those options are considered and presented to clients so that they are able to receive the right funding support from the outset. This is one of the core reasons why Time Finance offers a broad portfolio of solutions – from <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/asset-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Asset Finance</a>, to <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Invoice Finance</a>, <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/loans" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Commercial Loans,</a> <a href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/property-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Property Finance</a> and <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/vehicle-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vehicle Finance</a>. It means that despite the challenges or opportunities lying ahead, we can help keep businesses moving.</p>]]></content>

		<updated><![CDATA[2022-06-17 14:15:00]]></updated>
		<content><![CDATA[<p align="center" style="text-align: left;">Business demands are constantly changing, but the rising cost of doing business, supply chain concerns, and cashflow challenges we've seen throughout 2022 have just made finding the right solution to suit those needs that much more difficult. Today's SMEs want to get capital faster and easier than ever before, while still retaining a human touch with their brokers and funders. When it comes to offering such support, Time Finance believe that speed, simplicity, and service make up the winning formula.</p>

<p align="center" style="text-align: left;">
	<br>
</p>

<p><strong>The need for speed</strong></p>

<p>Time is one of the most valuable assets a business can have; it’s what gives them the freedom to grow their business at a pace which suits them. Pair this with access to finance and there’s a lot in which businesses can achieve.</p>

<p>Investment in technology and AI have undoubtedly helped the lending industry to accelerate the process of delivering funding solutions. Whether it’s allowing firms or brokers to quickly submit a proposal, or conducting due-diligence and eligibility checks, potential clients can receive a decision faster than ever before.</p>

<p>But, time and time again we see companies with enormous potential held back by algorithms and an inability to tick the necessary boxes. With no one to discuss a proposal with, convey their story to, or explain why, we're left with a sea of suffering businesses with nowhere to turn. That’s why speed alone isn’t enough.</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>When it comes to service, it’s all about the human touch</strong></p>

<p>While technological advancements are clearly changing the future of lending, they must be accompanied by a personalised approach to assisting businesses in realising their potential and identifying new opportunities. Access to a real person, particularly during difficult times, reminds businesses that they are not alone and invites them into a two-way conversation in which they can properly communicate their needs and concerns.</p>

<p>It's no surprise that a relationship-driven approach is one of the most important service offerings that business owners look for in a funder. In fact, according to a recent Time Finance poll, 92 percent of businesses claimed that having a personal relationship with their funder is at the top of their list of desirable attributes.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p><strong>Keeping it simple</strong></p>

<p>Being easy to deal with is one of the forgotten but most effective qualities brokers and funders need to adopt. With forecasts of a recession looming for later this year, for many the outlook can feel very worrying. Making access to finance as straightforward and simple as possible will go a long way towards easing some of the pressure associated with seeking financial help.</p>

<p><a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time Finance</a> continues to create solutions that meet the evolving needs of businesses. Their ‘Fast Track’ solution was established earlier this year to make it easier for brokers to deliver <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/asset-finance">Asset Finance solutions</a> to their clients. By pairing swift proposal processes with a forward-thinking underwriting team, brokers and their business owner clients are no longer held back by lengthy approval processes or tick box exercises. Time Finance is committed to collaborating with the broker community to ensure that speed, simplicity and an excellent service stay at the forefront of what they do.</p>]]></content>

		<slug><![CDATA[7-in-10-businesses-preparing-for-2022-recession]]></slug>
		<published><![CDATA[2022-06-22 09:00:00]]></published>
		<updated><![CDATA[2022-06-22 09:00:00]]></updated>
		<content><![CDATA[<p>New data from <a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time Finance</a> has revealed the scale of impact on UK SMEs as the cost of doing business continues to rise, with 72% of businesses currently preparing for an imminent recession.</p>

<p>The latest survey has seen Time Finance investigate the consequences currently being felt by UK businesses as they grapple with rising energy and fuel costs, increased National Insurance and supply chain issues.</p>

<p>Of the businesses surveyed, one in three said they are now scaling back investment with 27% freezing wage increases, 18% halting recruitment and one in ten reducing their personnel.</p>

<p><strong>Ed Rimmer, Chief Executive Officer at Time Finance, commented:</strong> “The majority of businesses we have spoken to as part of our latest survey are preparing for a recession this year. While this is understandable, it’s a worrying statistic. Reports of a looming recession can over inflate a sense of caution. It changes the way businesses look to the future; they scale back investment, halt recruitment and some even reduce their workforce. This can in-turn become a catalyst for a recession.</p>

<p>“Businesses are undoubtedly facing huge financial challenges as their costs increase across the board but how businesses respond to these challenges will have a direct impact on the health of our economy. Reckless spending will never make a successful business, but too much austerity can stunt growth. There is a compromise to be found and businesses need support to find that middle ground, to be able to balance the books while still moving forward.”</p>

<p>Time Finance’s survey also revealed that 65% of intermediaries predict a rise in business insolvencies as a result of rising costs.</p>

<p><strong>Ed continued:</strong> “Insolvencies are a natural part of our economic life cycle; consumer trends and market conditions evolve constantly, and these changes have been much more rapid over the past two years. As these changes take place, some businesses adapt and some cease trading. That said, if the rate of insolvencies escalates then that simply means there has been insufficient support for those businesses. Our survey showed that one in five businesses said they were unable to remain competitive. This figure is too high and it is our industry’s job to support those viable businesses, to work with them to find the right funding solutions that help weather the storm while also facilitating growth.”</p>

<p>When asked which areas of business were most impacted by price hikes, materials and stock from suppliers ranked the highest at 64% closely followed by energy and utilities at 45%, and employment costs and National Insurance - both 36%.</p>

<p><strong>Ed added:</strong> “No sooner are businesses adjusting to one price hike that they face another. That can be overwhelming. It’s putting businesses back in survival mode, a position many hadn’t quite emerged from post lockdown. There’s no question that intervention is needed from the Government to prevent the cost of doing business, and the cost of living, from rising any further. In the meantime, our industry has a valuable role to play. Unlike traditional lending, alternative finance is a constant presence in good times and bad.”</p>

		<updated><![CDATA[2022-07-01 09:25:00]]></updated>
		<content><![CDATA[<p>In a special feature with <a href="https://www.commercialreporter.co.uk/features/businesses-need-speed-but-not-at-the-cost-of-relationships.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Commercial Reporter</a>, our Director of Asset Finance Steve Nichols emphasizes the importance of speed when it comes to supporting businesses, but not at the costs of relationships.</p>

<p>The financial pressures currently facing businesses are undeniable. Having to adjust to rising costs in their supply chains, increased energy prices and bigger tax bills, and no sooner do we all begin to accept these challenges do we face inflation hitting a high of 9.1%. The squeeze on businesses is getting increasingly tighter and this creates an environment in which they need to think fast. To enable them to be agile, they need simple and quick finance solutions that meet their ever-changing demands. But speed alone will fall short of the financial solutions businesses need.</p>

<p>In a fast paced world, a business’ time is extremely valuable and when it comes to their finance solutions, they are rightly looking for products and services that are respectful of their time pressures. Onerous, confusing and lengthy finance applications have no place in our world so it is the duty of finance providers to make access to finance solutions simple, straightforward and quick. But the latter requires balance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Advancements in tech and AI have really accelerated the process of delivering funding solutions. Businesses and brokers can submit proposals and undertake due diligence and eligibility checks at the touch of a button with funding approved or denied almost immediately. On the face of it, that’s great. A business has its decision and it can move on. But while these algorithms create efficiency, the process is too black and white. If you don’t fit the algorithms, you’re denied finance. But would a business not then want the chance to discuss their nuances and explain their potential? Those are the shades of grey that require a human touch. It is the job of alternative finance to provide quality support to businesses and AI algorithms alone simply can’t do that.</p>

<p>In a recent Time Finance poll, a staggering 92 percent of businesses told us that having a personal relationship with their funder is at the top of their list of desirable attributes. But it’s interesting to question why this might be, and particularly now. Maybe a business has been denied access to funding elsewhere, perhaps they want to have a product or service explained to them in terms they understand or maybe we just prefer to deal with people, especially in times of uncertainty.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There’s no doubt that technological advancements are changing the future of lending and progress is undoubtedly a positive thing; it enables lenders to bring to market new products and services that meet the needs of businesses. At Time Finance we recently launched ‘Fast Track’ our new Asset Finance solution that initially will provide a select panel of brokers with access to soft asset finance facilities up to £10,000, giving swift decisions and easy access to funds. But alongside this, we value the conversations we can have to talk through a business’ specific needs or challenges. Access to a real person, particularly during difficult times, reminds businesses that they are not alone and invites them into a two-way conversation in which they can properly communicate their business vision.</p>

<p><a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time Finance</a> launched its<a href="https://timefinance.com/press-releases/time-finance-to-fast-track-businesses-investment-plans-with-new-product-launch" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&nbsp;Fast Track Asset Finance Solution</a> in May this year to make it easier for brokers to deliver <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/asset-finance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Asset Finance solution</a>s to their clients. By pairing swift proposal processes with a forward-thinking underwriting team, brokers and their business owner clients are no longer held back by lengthy approval processes or tick box exercises. Time Finance is committed to collaborating with the broker community to ensure that speed, simplicity and an excellent service stay at the forefront of what they do.</p>]]></content>

		<updated><![CDATA[2022-07-05 09:00:00]]></updated>

<p>Matt brings over 12 years’ experience to the role, the last 10 of which in a business development role with Aldermore Bank.

<p><strong>Speaking of his appointment, Matt said:&nbsp;</strong>“Having supported businesses of all shapes, sizes and sectors across the South of England for the last decade, I know first hand just how many opportunities there are to help firms in this region. It’s a crucial time to be joining the Time Finance team when wider economic challenges leave many business owners in need of affordable funding solutions to support investment plans and help them to take advantage of growth opportunities that arise.</p>

		<content><![CDATA[<p align="center" style="text-align: left;">As the Government unveils its new campaign to encourage businesses to cut their prices, we caught up with Time Finance CEO, Ed Rimmer, to find out what this latest move really means for businesses as they continue to grapple with the cost of doing business crisis.</p>

<p align="center" style="text-align: left;">
	<br>
</p>

<p><strong><em>What is the new Government campaign and what does it mean for businesses?</em></strong></p>

<p>In a new tax-funded campaign, the Government will ask businesses to cut their prices in order to help alleviate soaring costs for consumers. Whilst there is no obligation for businesses to take part, firms are incentivised to do so with the benefit of being able to carry and showcase the campaign’s name and logo across their own branding.</p>

<p>No one is in any doubt that the cost of living crisis must be addressed, but businesses are themselves facing rising costs - supply chain prices, increased National Insurance, rising employment costs, fuel prices and inflation to name just a few. Putting pressure on businesses to reduce their prices does not guarantee huge change for the consumer and it tightens the squeeze on businesses that are already struggling to make ends meet.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p><strong>Will this initiative from the Government make a difference?</strong></p>

<p>The new campaign is drawing a lot of criticism, and for good reason. It aims to protect the consumer, but it fails to tackle the root cause of the issue. The initiative may well work at keeping some costs down for consumers, but if measures aren’t put in place to support businesses then it will quickly have an adverse impact on their survival and the wider economy. We recently surveyed our business community and found that 91% of businesses are having to increase their costs as a result of rising overheads, and one in five are hiking these prices by a significant 30%.</p>

<p>Small businesses simply don’t have the financial capacity to absorb their rising costs, and without proper and viable support their overheads will be squeezed ever tighter. Not only will those businesses struggle to keep up with operational costs such as paying suppliers, staff wages or making critical investments for growth, but some sadly just won’t survive.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p><strong><em>How is the cost of living crisis affecting businesses?</em></strong></p>

<p>We’ve noticed a significant shift in client demand and the level of financial support they require from us. Far more businesses are struggling with cashflow challenges as a direct result of the cost of living crisis and without our help, many are concerned about what the future outlook for their business looks like. Businesses are having to delicately balance their responsibility to keep costs fair for the consumer while also remaining viable by carefully managing their finances. At Time Finance, our teams are reacting quickly to ensure that financial solutions are accessible and swiftly packaged and are continuing to look for new ways to support businesses.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p><strong><em>What more can the Government be doing to help businesses?</em></strong></p>

<p>Over the last couple of years, the Government has introduced a considerable number of new measures to support businesses. What we need to see now is a dedicated response to the cost of living crisis. Applying pressure on small businesses will only make matters worse. Businesses need respite from overheads - whether that’s a pause on VAT or Business Rates - before they can start to think about lowering costs.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p><strong><em>What is Time Finance doing to support businesses now?</em></strong></p>

<p>We’ve increased the level of funding support we offer to businesses and invested in the expansion of our internal teams, particularly within business development and risk, to meet the rise in demand for finance. As well as this, we’ve reacted quickly to launch new financial solutions onto the market that are designed to make access to finance easy.</p>

<p>One of our latest solutions, <a href="https://timefinance.com/press-releases/time-finance-to-fast-track-businesses-investment-plans-with-new-product-launch">‘Fast Track’</a> combines technology and a relationship-driven approach to not only accelerate the process by which brokers can apply for soft asset finance facilities on behalf of their business owner clients but to support the conversion of those proposals.</p>

<p>Our team works closely with brokers and business owners to tailor financial solutions that instil confidence and financial freedom to keep operations running smoothly – whether that’s to relieve the pressure on cashflow and help manage day to day expenses, inject working capital into a business for investment or to help make securing business critical assets possible. We continue to review our facilities with existing clients to ensure they have the right level of support to meet current needs as well as their future growth plans.</p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<p>In the wake of UK inflation reaching a 40-year high of 9.1%, <a href="https://timefinance.com/">Time Finance</a> reveals its latest data around the cost of doing business crisis, with 91% of UK SMEs forced to hike their own prices in order to keep up with soaring operational costs.</p>

<p>The latest survey has seen Time Finance investigate the true impact currently being felt by UK businesses as they grapple with rising energy and fuel costs, increased National Insurance, rising wage bills, supply chain issues and the recent rise in inflation to 9.1%.</p>

<p><a href="https://timefinance.com/time-blog/alternative-financing-explained">The alternative finance provider</a> reveals that one in five businesses fear they are struggling to remain competitive in the wake of rising costs. 63% of firms were found to have increased their prices by 10% and one in five by up to a significant 30%.</p>

<p>Whether permanent or short-term measures, these vast figures show just how hard hit UK businesses currently are, with this knock on effect naturally filtering down to be felt most heavily by customers.</p>

<p>Of the businesses surveyed, ‘soaring energy and utility costs’ and the rising ‘cost of materials and stock’ ranked the two greatest threats to businesses right now.</p>

<p><strong>Ed Rimmer, Time Finance Chief Executive Officer, commented</strong>: “It’s no secret that the cost of living is rising at a rapid and unmanageable pace of late. Our recent survey figures show first hand the significant impact that this is now having on both our small business network and only further amplifies the domino effect this then has on consumers and local communities.</p>

<p>“Our figures show that one in five businesses are struggling to remain competitive and this also creates cause for concern. As inflation continues to rise at an accelerated rate, the only option businesses have to deflect the detrimental impact and continue trading, is to increase their costs. But with the interest rate now taking a hike consecutively month on month, the mountain of rising costs across the board are not sustainable for anyone. Something needs to change in order for businesses to not only survive, but create jobs, inspire innovation and continue generating wealth for our economy.</p>

<p>“On top of this, we’ve found that nearly 50% of the business owners we spoke to are considering switching to cheaper supply chains. While this kind of impact can usually be predicted during times of financial hardship, changes to a company's supply chain can worsen their circumstances by impacting the quality of products or services delivered.</p>

<p>“Something’s got to give in the coming weeks and months for businesses to remain viable, as reactive changes to their service offering and increasing costs will only go so far in overcoming the challenges they face.”</p>

<p>Time Finance supports some 20,000 business owners each year through a range of financial solutions that are designed to inspire innovation and growth. With <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance">Invoice Finance</a> facilities ranging between £10,000 and £2.5million, <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/loans">Business Loans</a> up to £500,000, <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/vehicle-finance">Vehicle Finance</a> and <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/asset-finance">Asset Finance</a> facilities, businesses have the working capital available to overcome challenges and grasp hold of opportunities for growth. Last month, Time Finance launched <a href="https://timefinance.com/press-releases/time-finance-to-fast-track-businesses-investment-plans-with-new-product-launch">‘Fact Track’</a> to provide brokers and their SME clients with quick access to business critical assets, further demonstrating their commitment to helping more businesses access the financial support they so desperately need.</p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<p>Scaling back investment will have a wider economic impact, warns <a href="https://timefinance.com/about-us">Time Finance</a> as new data shows that businesses are making huge sacrifices due to rising costs, with one in five unable to invest in growing their business.</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>As part of a survey to expose the extent of challenges currently facing businesses, Time Finance also found that one in ten firms are unable to meet their existing financial commitments due to the rising cost of doing business.</p>

<p>The new data comes as the recently appointed Cost of Living Tsar is set to roll out a campaign to encourage businesses to reduce their prices in a bid to manage the cost of living crisis, a measure that will add insult to injury for businesses, explains Time Finance.</p>

<p><strong>Ed Rimmer, CEO of Time Finance, comments:</strong> “There is undoubtedly a huge cost of living crisis that must be addressed but by putting the onus on businesses to reduce their prices while they themselves are experiencing rising costs, we would simply be solving one problem by exacerbating another.</p>

<p>“There’s disarray within the Government at present, which arguably is preventing true action being taken against rising costs but even so, months of inaction are causing further damage across the board. The businesses we speak to are clearly feeling the squeeze; National Insurance has increased, the cost of materials, stock, energy and fuel has risen dramatically and disruption to their supply chain is making it difficult to meet demand and stay competitive. To ask businesses to pledge to keep their prices down in the face of such a challenge is extremely short-sighted.</p>

<p>“Much of the work we do at Time Finance helps business owners to bring their investment plans to life. All of which fuels economic growth, from enabling firms to expand into new markets, diversify their offering or grow their operations and employ more staff. To see that a fifth of businesses cannot afford to invest in their own growth is a worrying indication of where our economy is headed. If we don’t prioritise support for businesses, not only will they struggle to keep up with the day-to-day costs of running a business such as paying suppliers, staff wages or making critical investments, but sadly some just won’t survive.”</p>

<p>Time Finance found in early July that 63% of firms have already increased their prices by 10% and one in five by up to a significant 30%. For some businesses, increasing their prices has been a necessary measure to stay afloat, but as business costs continue to soar and the government begins to pile on the pressure for businesses to reduce their costs, many will be left in a state of dismay.</p>

<p>Time Finance supports some 20,000 business owners each year through a range of financial solutions that are designed to inspire innovation and growth. With <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance">Invoice Finance</a> facilities ranging between £10,000 and £2.5million, <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/loans">Business Loans</a> up to £500,000, <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/vehicle-finance">Vehicle Finance</a> and <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/asset-finance">Asset Finance</a> facilities, businesses have the working capital available to overcome challenges and grasp hold of opportunities for growth. Last month, Time Finance launched <a href="https://timefinance.com/press-releases/time-finance-to-fast-track-businesses-investment-plans-with-new-product-launch">‘Fact Track’</a> to provide brokers and their SME clients with quick access to business critical assets, further demonstrating their commitment to helping more businesses access the financial support they so desperately need.</p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<p>Placing further financial strain on businesses will cause widespread damage to the UK economy, warns Time Finance, as the Bank of England announces its sharpest increase in interest rates in 25 years in a bid to combat rising inflation.</p>

<p>The caution comes as the Bank of England increases its interest rate by 0.5% to 1.75%, a move that will have a detrimental impact on UK business confidence when the challenge of rising costs continues to worsen.</p>

<p><strong>Ed Rimmer, Chief Executive Officer at Time Finance, commented:&nbsp;</strong>“The latest interest rate rise is simply another blow to business confidence and places even more financial strain on our economic recovery as we continue to grapple with rising costs.</p>

<p>“There are arguable benefits to this move from the Bank of England as it has faced mounting pressure to keep up with the pace of global central banks, but it is short sighted. We know that an interest rate rise alone cannot curb inflation; the challenges around soaring costs need to end somewhere because for UK businesses this simply isn’t sustainable. The IMF recently adjusted its predictions for UK growth in 2023 to just 0.5% compared with the predicted 1.2% earlier this year. So, the big question here is what will happen to these figures if Government intervention doesn’t happen soon? Well, for many businesses it will slow down growth, making the impending recession a self-fulfilling prophecy. Instead, we need action that stimulates economic growth.</p>

<p>“Few businesses have the luxury of using their own capital to finance investment, and for some, it isn’t enough to manage day-to-day expenses, like paying their own suppliers, HMRC or employees. That’s a worrying outlook.</p>

<p>“Already we’re seeing demand for finance rise, as business concerns grow over the possibility of a recession. Many, who were trading around the time of the last recession know just how challenging this can be and will fear that traditional lending routes, like the highstreet Banks, will close their doors once again and withdraw their support.</p>

<p>“The role of alternative finance has for a long time filled a void in supporting SMEs where some lenders have fallen short in challenging economic markets. Business appetite for growth doesn’t dwindle simply because some funders have tightened the purse strings. Businesses need and deserve funding partners who are available to listen and really understand their concerns, not turn their backs when the going gets tough. No one is in any doubt that borrowing must be done responsibly, wisely and at the right time but without it, the economic growth the UK desperately needs simply won’t be achievable.”</p>

		<content><![CDATA[<p align="center" style="text-align: left;">With our new Prime Minister now in Number 10 and with a full cabinet reshuffle complete, Time Finance CEO, Ed Rimmer, shares his thoughts on what’s next for the Government as the economic outlook continues to worry businesses across the UK.</p>

<p>We have had two different people take up the mantle of Chancellor of the Exchequer since Rishi Sunak delivered his Spring Statement back in March this year. At the time, a whole host of things were promised to businesses, which if we’re being honest were overdue even six months ago. Those promises - of measures to boost productivity, support innovation and enable skills investment - have yet to materialise. Our new PM may have cleared out her opponent’s supporters from the cabinet, but Sunak’s Spring Statement promises must not be forgotten.</p>

<p>Like almost everyone in the UK, businesses are having to adjust to some extremely tight purse strings. They are unprotected by an energy price cap and so rising utilities, increasing fuel costs, business rates, National Insurance, Corporation Tax - the list goes on - all need to be paid at the same time as trying to keep their own prices down while simultaneously increasing staff wages to help with the cost of living crisis. It simply isn’t sustainable and the outlook is worrying.</p>

<p>Our new Prime Minister’s campaign for leadership focused initially on cutting taxes, promising to reverse the rise in National Insurance and curb further increases to Corporation Tax. This is estimated to cost £30bn a year, so while it could bring some relief to businesses, it does beg the question - will it be enough to support them? Cutting overheads is one thing, but there is a bigger picture here. We need measures that will stimulate business growth.</p>

<p>In the Spring Statement, Rishi Sunak outlined his areas of focus for businesses, which at the time were wrapped up in a yet-to-be-seen plan to create ‘conditions for growth’ and ‘a new culture for enterprise’. There were three strands to this: people, ideas and capital. It all sounds positive, but it came alongside figures that the UK is lagging behind globally in skills, research and development and productivity.</p>

<p>To be clear, that lag is not the fault of UK businesses, who have kept their heads above water in some of the most challenging of conditions. Many have diversified to survive lockdowns, political turmoil, ever-changing pressures and rising costs. If we are not performing against our global counterparts, it is because we do not have the infrastructure in place to do so.</p>

<p>So what could businesses have hoped for from Sunak’s (now hypothetical) Spring Statement? Tax incentives to invest in training, R&amp;D tax credits, expanded relief to include cloud, data and pure maths, tax cuts on business investment to fuel private sector investment. The reality is that with the changing economic landscape, these measures may never have materialised come November. But one thing is for certain - our new Chancellor has got a very big task ahead. Significant change is needed, and fast.</p>]]></content>

		<published><![CDATA[2022-09-23 12:41:35]]></published>
		<updated><![CDATA[2022-09-23 12:41:35]]></updated>
		<content><![CDATA[<p align="center" style="text-align: left;"><strong>With a raft of tax cuts and policy reforms announced in the Chancellor’s Mini Budget, we caught up with Time Finance’s CEO, Ed Rimmer, to get his thoughts on the new measures announced and what they really mean for small businesses.</strong></p>

<p>SMEs account for 99.9% of the UK economy, but they were not at the forefront of the Chancellor’s Mini Budget. Scrapping the planned rise to Corporation Tax and reversing the rise to NI is welcome news for all businesses, as are the measures to curb energy bills, but these tax cuts will disproportionately benefit those that are less in need. Where are the measures to support small businesses in making investments for their growth in terms of skills and research and development? SMEs are the backbone of a healthy economy and yet there is little to support them aside from reduced energy costs, marginal tax cuts and a promise of a simplified tax system.</p>

<p>The Government wants to create a nation of entrepreneurs and while the emphasis for the Mini-Budget was rumoured to be on reducing costs, there are some signs that the Chancellor is looking at the bigger picture to stimulate economic growth. It’s great to see a dedicated and targeted approach to investment zones. Businesses will now benefit from a pause on business rate payments and stamp duty fees. Not only this, but businesses will have a capped National Insurance for new employees in these zones. This investment in levelling up is a great step forward for businesses and will offer firms, both large and small the opportunity to put down roots and thrive in new and bustling business communities. Tax cuts for plant and machinery will also help businesses to enhance or diversify their operations, but it is one of many measures needed to cultivate the kind of innovation that we need to see to stimulate the economy and compete in global markets.</p>

<p>Though the Chancellor argued the merits of scrapping the cap of bankers’ bonuses, it does point to a distortion of priorities and they are pressing ahead with these plans without scrutiny. Changes to Income Tax, National Insurance and Stamp Duty beg the question of how the Government is costing its plans. The Mini Budget has not been accompanied by forecasts from the OBR, so its impact on borrowing and economic growth are unknown. The Chancellor wants the economy to grow by an average of 2.5% but without timescales and without input from the OBR, the measures announced do feel like a bit of a stab in the dark.</p>

<p>We work with 10,000 UK businesses and our experience is that at the moment many small businesses are back in survival mode and that creates caution, stunting growth and ultimately economic recovery. From the Mini Budget we needed a plan from the Government that looks at the bigger picture and puts small businesses at the top of the agenda. Our former Chancellor hinted at this back in the Spring Statement, and whilst conditions have changed since then, businesses need consistency to feel confident. Yes, they need support with overheads, particularly rising costs, but they also need a Government that is behind them, that creates stability and conditions where they can be bold, ambitious and innovative. That is how we stimulate the economy.</p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<p>On Friday morning, Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng set out the steps the Government will take to stimulate economic growth. If you missed the announcement, here are the key takeaways and what this might mean for your business…<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Tax cuts</strong></p>

<p>In his ambition to make Britain a nation of entrepreneurs, the Chancellor announced a number of significant tax incentives. Perhaps the most significant to businesses is the planned increase in Corporation Tax from 19% to 25% and the planned 1.25% increase in NI - both of which have been scrapped. From next year, the UK will have a single higher rate of Income Tax of 40% as the top rate is abolished. The basic rate of Income Tax will also be cut to 19p in April 2023. These cuts are expected to impact over 28 million people, saving workers on average £330 a year.</p>

<p>Whilst the Office for Budget Responsibility is not expected to publish its own forecasts, the Treasury has estimated that the tax cuts will cost £27bn next year and £45bn by 2026-27.</p>

<p><strong>Investment zones</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The Mini Budget also detailed the Government’s dedicated approach and investment into businesses across the country. The Chancellor announced 40 new areas of ‘Investment Zones’. These geographical locations have been developed to attract business to areas of the country like the West Midlands, the Tees Valley and Somerset.</p>

<p>Newly occupied businesses in these zones will benefit from the scrapping of Stamp Duty fees, a pause on Business Rate payments and the removal of National Insurance charges on the first £50,000 earned by a new employee. These new zones present a great opportunity for businesses to thrive and are a real step forwards for businesses, both large and small.</p>

<p><strong>Energy relief packages</strong></p>

<p>The eagerly awaited support packages for businesses in the face of rising energy costs was also set out in the Government’s plan. Wholesale energy costs for businesses, charities and the public sector will be capped as part of the ‘Energy Relief Scheme’. This will provide a guarantee equivalent to that set out for households earlier this month. Whilst this scheme will provide much needed support for businesses and households alike, the cost of subsidising both business and domestic energy bills will cost £60bn over the next six months.</p>

<p><strong>Annual investment allowance (AIA)</strong></p>

<p>The planned reduction in Annual Investment Allowance (AIA) to £200,000 in April next year was also scrapped by the Chancellor, fixing this cap permanently at £1m. Under this measure, businesses investing in new plant and machinery will receive 100% tax relief up to the value of £1m. Expected to cover the investment needs of 99% of UK businesses, the permanent rate will bring more certainty to many and further demonstrates the Government’s focus on strong economic investment.</p>

<p><strong>Ed Rimmer, Chief Executive Officer at Time Finance commented:</strong> “We’re pleased to head into our new financial year with such positive momentum and our continued commitment to create confidence in the market and encourage economic growth. We have a clear objective to grow our lending book to £250m as part of a medium term plan, combined with maximising our multiproduct offering and focusing on our core proposition of Asset Finance, Invoice Finance and Business Loans.</p>

		<content><![CDATA[<p>Running your own business can take your working life to the next level, something that many never get the chance to experience. The personal gain and reward associated with being captain of your own ship is second to none for the majority of business owners, yet the lesser acknowledged side to this honour, inevitably rears its head in times of difficulty.</p>

<p>The mental health of business owners has become a harder battle to manage. As the UK’s economic landscape continues to throw curveballs in their direction, things are rapidly declining for the mental health of SME business owners. According to <a href="https://www.fsb.org.uk/resources-page/one-in-three-business-owners-suffer-covid-linked-mental-health-decline-new-study-finds-as-mental-health-awareness-week-launches.html">FSB</a>, one in three business owners currently suffer from Covid-mental health decline. With 5.5 million small businesses currently in the UK, this statistic highlights some 1,800,000 business owners are in disarray. Now is the time to address this crisis before matters worsen.</p>

<p><strong>Communication builds communities&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Very few have been caught unscathed by the events of the last few years, and in the midst of these financial woes and global crises, it’s naturally quite difficult to take the time for yourself. Business owners are used to some level of stress but as these levels creep higher it’s important to recognise the difference between the usual stresses and strains of running your business and something more long lasting. When a feeling of worry or sadness prologues, it's important to seek help, for the sake of your business, its employees and your own wellbeing.</p>

<p>As with any issue, ‘a problem shared is a problem halved’. Talking about the burden of work stresses and difficulties can mean the difference between a surviving business and a thriving one. By forming communities with other business owners, mentors or SME support groups you can impact your operations for the better.</p>

<p><strong>SMEs are the lifeline of the economy&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Universally, business management and leadership roles have brought about some level of stress, whether it's the launch week for a new product, a rush of business ahead of the Christmas period or working hours that come at the cost of quality time with loved ones. But for small businesses, many find the role a far more personal burden, with the lines between work and personal life much more blurred.</p>

<p>For many small business owners (particularly those just setting up) taking on the roles of Manager Director, HR, sales, marketing and finance all in one is not an unusual practice. With smaller work forces, usually comes a closer unit; one's workforce can become far more connected and reliant on a business owner personally. Marry these unique circumstances with a global pandemic, economic uncertainty and loss of profit, and the simple task of paying somebody’s salary can weigh heavy on management’s shoulders.</p>

<p><strong>World Mental Health Day&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>At Time Finance, we aim to encourage conversation around mental health so that we can better understand how the finance industry can continue to support business owners.</p>

<p>We understand first hand the impact that bumps in the road can have for our clients and we’re working harder than ever to ensure they are supported at every step along the way, through a compassionate and personable approach to funding. This approach is absolutely vital to helping ensure these SMEs bolster their business in a way that suits their specific business needs, whilst also being suitable and realistic to their own pace of growth and situation. We always take the time to research and truly understand a business' standpoint before offering the right solution, and this is a service level that our clients have always valued.</p>

		<content><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://timefinance.com/">Time Finance</a> has launched a brand new tree planting initiative to support a greener future and broaden its commitment to sustainability.</p>

<p>Launched in partnership with <a href="https://eforests.co.uk/time-finance/">EFORESTS</a>, the new #OneTreeAtATime initiative will see Time Finance plant a tree for every new employee that joins its business, ensuring its growth brings a positive impact on the environment.</p>

<p>Through the partnership, Time Finance has already planted 140 trees in community woodlands, nature reserves and community farms across the UK for every existing member of its team.</p>

<p><strong>Ed Rimmer, Chief Executive of Time Finance, commented:</strong> “Our local communities are at the heart of our business, and this extends well beyond supporting local business growth. We recognise the wider, positive impact Time Finance can make towards creating a greener future, and our newly launched Plant A Tree Scheme is just one small step in achieving that.</p>

<p>“Our team is integral to our business and ensuring they are represented in our community initiatives is really important to us. Our Plant A Tree Scheme enables each one of Time Finance’s people to contribute individually to a greener future, but also demonstrates the collective impact we can have together.”</p>

<p>Fulfilling a commitment to support a greener future for its employees and wider business community, the new initiative forms part of Time Finance’s wider Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) strategy.</p>

<p><strong>Ed continued:</strong> “We have plans to grow and as we do, so can our support for local communities and our wider environment. Aligned to our #OneTreeAtATime initiative is our ESG strategy, which we will look to develop further over the coming months and years.”</p>

<p>Time Finance supports some 10,000 UK businesses with flexible and supportive funding solutions that enable businesses to achieve their goals, whether branching out into new markets, cultivating innovation or enhancing their own sustainability.

		<content><![CDATA[<p>Time Finance is pleased to announce the launch of its <a href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/asset-based-lending-solutions">new Asset Based Lending (ABL) solution</a>, designed to help UK businesses unlock working capital and raise the finance they need to drive their ambitions forward.</p>

<p>In response to an increased demand for tailored funding solutions as many businesses juggle rising costs with achieving their growth plans, Time Finance have launched a new product offering to the UK SME market.</p>

<p>Its ABL offering enables businesses to access funds otherwise tied up in assets within their business, including plant and machinery, stock, and commercial property. Working alongside an Invoice Finance facility, Time Finance can unlock up to £2.5million in working capital, giving business owners a more flexible and personalised approach to financing growth.</p>

<p><strong>Sharon Bryden, Director of Commercial Loans &amp; ABL, said:</strong> “We are excited to launch our new ABL offering. It comes at a crucial time for SMEs when now more than ever those business owners need a funding partner who can take a holistic and flexible view to providing finance. At Time Finance, we can do just that.”</p>

		<content><![CDATA[<p>Time Finance is pleased to announce that it has reached a record high in its lending book, as it hits a £145m milestone of funding support delivered to UK businesses.</p>

<p>The news follows the release of its annual performance results last month, as <a href="https://timefinance.com/">Time Finance</a> continues to celebrate significant growth in its own lending book. The finance firm has enjoyed fifteen consecutive months of growth as it supports some 10,000 SMEs with its broad portfolio of financial solutions; from Asset Finance, to Invoice Finance, Business Loans, Vehicle Finance and <a href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/asset-based-lending">Asset Based Lending</a>.</p>

<p>This celebrated peak in lending can be attributed to the increased demand for both Invoice Finance solutions and Hard Asset offering as businesses of all sizes turn to finance to support current economic challenges and grasp hold of opportunities for growth.</p>

<p><strong>Chief Executive Officer, Ed Rimmer comments:</strong> “Our renewed strategy has dedicated a real drive toward boosting our lending to UK businesses, and to see the traction being gained here in consecutive months is very pleasing to see. These results mark the start of an exciting period of growth for Time Finance and only further demonstrates the strength of our lending model and business strategy.</p>

<p>“Our hugely dedicated and expert-led teams play a key role in helping us to achieve these milestone figures. Not only do they offer our clients a flexible and common-sense approach to lending, but their responsiveness and dedication to tailoring a solution that really supports our client’s specific needs is what sets Time Finance apart.</p>

<p>“The investments we have made to both our teams and operations over the last year have enabled us to take our business from strength to strength; whether that’s through key appointments or launching new products and solutions. The next 12 months will see Time Finance continue to look for innovative ways to inspire confidence and growth in the SME market and increase our support to UK businesses.”</p>

<p>This news comes at a vital time for the business as it also launches a new Asset Based Lending (ABL) product, aimed to meet the rising demand for more flexible finance solutions. Time Finance’s ABL offering will enable businesses to better access funds that would otherwise be tied up in assets within their business - including plant and machinery, inventory, commercial property and invoices.</p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<p>New data from <a href="https://timefinance.com/about-us">Time Finance</a> shows the scale of business resilience in the face of ongoing economic uncertainty and rising costs, as investment for growth remains a top priority for UK firms.</p>

<p>Gauging a shift in confidence over the past 12 months, Time Finance’s most recent survey set out to uncover appetite for investment and how optimistic SMEs are feeling about the future. Its findings reveal that despite the financial challenges businesses continue to face, 74% believe now is a good time to invest in their future, a figure which is up from 69% last year.</p>

<p>When asked what the priority areas of investment are right now, over half of businesses put operations and technology at the top of that list, marking a considerable increase from last year’s findings which saw just 21% consider this a priority.</p>

<p>In its previous survey, Time Finance found investment in new personnel to be the leading priority for UK businesses, with one in three planning to expand their workforce and bring in new talent. This figure has since fallen, as just one in five firms are now putting recruitment at the forefront of their business strategy.</p>

<p><strong>Ed Rimmer, Chief Executive Officer at Time Finance, said:</strong> “A lot is said about the financial challenges businesses are facing, and these are without question a daily reality for SMEs. Less is said about the defiance that keeps these businesses, and our economy, going in the face of uncertainty.</p>

<p>“It’s interesting to see the continued shift in business focus and increased resilience to the challenges faced in the wider economy. Despite the pressure of rising costs, overheads increasing and margins being squeezed, businesses continue to prioritise their plans for innovation and growth. With over half prioritising investment in their operations and technology at the top of their agenda, it’s encouraging to see optimism on the rise and appetite for success and growth still thriving.</p>

<p>“The optimism felt right now does appear to be partnered with some caution. Caution can be valuable; it helps to avoid impulsive decisions but it can also hold businesses back. Our survey revealed that 48% of businesses are unsure of what lies ahead, and while this is understandable in the current climate, it really emphasises the importance of sound financial planning. Partnering with a reliable funder is vital here to ensure that businesses can build in the headroom to achieve their growth ambitions.</p>

<p>“So, while we have reason to be hopeful about the fighting spirit of British businesses, it is undeniable that they need stability and certainty as they navigate the next 12 months and bring their investment plans to life. It has been a tumultuous year in so many ways, but what has remained a constant is the incredible strength of our business community.”</p>]]></content>

		<slug><![CDATA[cop27-is-the-road-to-net-zero-still-a-priority-for-uk-smes]]></slug>
		<published><![CDATA[2022-11-09 15:11:48]]></published>
		<updated><![CDATA[2022-11-09 15:11:48]]></updated>
		<content><![CDATA[<p>As businesses begin to fasten their belts for new year planning and financial forecasting in 2023, environmental consciousness will no doubt be on their radar. And as COP27 commences in Egypt, there will be a renewed sense of urgency for ramping up sustainable business practices after a turbulent year of juggling priorities.</p>

<p>In a defining era in the fight against climate change, COP27 is due to inspire nations and join forces in the battle for a greener planet. For a great number of businesses already on their journey to achieving a national Net Zero target, this dedicated effort between global leaders will only help to cement the internal efforts and really drive their ongoing initiatives into 2023.</p>

<p>Yet for many, this event will serve as a stark reminder of the missed opportunities and shrinking budgets as 2022 draws to a close. At this time, many businesses have taken a significant hit amidst rapidly increasing energy bills and widespread damage to the economy. And in a month that has so far witnessed the Bank of England’s base rate rise by 0.75% - the most significant jump in over thirty years - the UK’s economy is no doubt in a tumultuous state. In our latest Going Green for Business survey, we found that affordability was the biggest barrier when it came to being more sustainable, so whilst the ambition is there for many SMEs, the means to action these desires is not actually in place.</p>

<p>This time last year, we surveyed a number of our small businesses community and found that 100% of respondents felt there was not enough Government support to help smaller firms reduce their carbon footprint. In the same breath, 100% of businesses said they were considering making investments to reduce their carbon footprint in the next six months. This proves just how dedicated UK SMEs are to the green agenda, despite a landscape which continues to throw curveballs in their direction.</p>

<p>With the Government’s Net Zero target still set at 2050, it feels simultaneously far away that action can be taken but close enough that businesses are still going to struggle to meet this goal whilst the day-to-day expenditure of running a business continues to rise. What businesses need most at this time is the working capital to invest in areas of the business that matter most to them.</p>

<p>With the end goal of ‘ultimate sustainability’ often feeling a little out of reach for some businesses, by dedicating smaller efforts into greener financial investments, such as technologies and machinery, businesses can set the wheels in motion for reaching those targets. By investing money to save money, the road to Net Zero - and achieving more sustainable practice - will be made all the bit easier.</p>

<p>Flexible financing solutions and a lender who can take a holistic approach will equip businesses with the vital funds that they need to make environmental ambitions a reality. Whether investing in new product lines, ensuring a greener supply chain or funding a greener fleet, unlocking working capital or taking on specific finance solutions will be the only option for many businesses looking to contribute to the Net Zero agenda.</p>

<p>COP26 feels recent enough that the urgency is still fresh in our minds, but in so many ways the world has changed in those 12 months since. The hope is that COP27 brings with it a fresh call to action accompanied by some solutions. We know that businesses have ambitions to become more sustainable, and whilst many are putting one foot forward to make these ambitions a reality, many more are juggling a lot of other priorities and, sustainability, worryingly, is at risk of becoming a nice-to-have. The Government’s decarbonisation targets remain very much intact; will it now put systems in place so that businesses can keep up on the journey to Net Zero?</p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<p>On Thursday morning, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt revealed his Autumn statement, setting out the Government’s plans to tackle inflation, steady the economy and stimulate growth. Aiming to respond to an ‘international crisis with British values,’ Hunt highlighted three key areas of focus: growth, stability, and public services.</p>

<p>Whilst some of the announced measures may come as unwelcome news to some, businesses can rest assured that the measures included in Thursday’s Autumn Statement have been costed and backed up by figures from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). Following the announcement, the OBR predicts that the measures put in place will lead to a drop in inflation from 9.1% this year to 7.4% in 2023.</p>

<p>The Chancellor confirmed that the UK economy is now in recession with the International Monetary Fund predicting a third of the World’s economy to follow suit either this year or next. Hailing his statement as a ‘balanced plan for stability,’ just under half of the Government’s £55bn consolidation will come from a hike in taxes and the rest from spending cuts in the public sphere.</p>

<p>If you didn’t manage to catch the announcement, here we look at some of the key measures laid out and what these might mean for UK businesses in the coming months and year.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h4><strong>Businesses’ Finances</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h4>

<p><strong>Business Rates</strong></p>

<p>Let's start with the positives; some of the measures laid out in this statement may come as a welcome surprise for businesses, with Hunt unveiling new measures introduced to help businesses and shops, a dedication worth nearly £14 billion. To protect businesses from rising inflation, business rates will no longer be increased in line with consumer prices inflation (CPI) from next April 2023, expected to save businesses £9.3 billion over the next five years.</p>

<p>The Chancellor also announced that the Government will go ahead with the business property revaluation in April 2023. Whilst this could eventually lead to higher rates for some, the package is set to benefit around 700,000 businesses and will mean business rate bills will increase by just 1%, according to the finance ministry.</p>

<p><strong>NICs&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The Chancellor also announced on Thursday that the Employers NICs threshold will be frozen until April 2028, however, the Government will retain the Employment Allowance at its new higher level of £500,000. According to Hunt, 40% of businesses will still pay no NICs at all.</p>

<p>The VAT registration threshold will also be maintained until March 2026, more than twice as high as EU and OECD averages.</p>

<p><strong>Research and Development (R&amp;D) Reforms&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>In his plan to make Britain the next ‘Silicon Valley’ and<strong>&nbsp;</strong>to make sure global corporations are paying the correct tax, the Chancellor announced reforms to R&amp;D tax schemes.</p>

<p>To tackle reports of abuse and fraud in R&amp;D tax relief, the deduction rate for the SME scheme will be cut to 86% and the credit rate to 10%, whilst increasing the rate of the separate R&amp;D expenditure credit from 13% to 20%.</p>

<p>With the OBR confirming the new measures have no detrimental impact on R&amp;D investment, the Government will work with the industry to understand what further R&amp;D support SMEs will require.</p>

<p><strong>Windfall Tax</strong></p>

<p>An increase in windfall tax to 35% was also brought about by the Autumn Statement, leading to an overall increase in oil and gas companies’ tax to 85% on UK profits. Extended from December 2025, this increase is now set to last until March 2028. Coupled with a 40% tax on profits from older renewable and nuclear electricity generation, this new measure is set to raise £14 billion for the economy next year alone.</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<h4><strong>Personal Finance</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h4>

<p><strong>Income Tax</strong></p>

<p>In a series of changes to personal taxation and wages, the threshold for the top rate of income tax will be brought down from £150,000 to £125,140. Income tax thresholds will also be frozen until 2028.</p>

<p>In its largest increase ever, National Living Wage will rise to £10.42 from 1 April 2023, equating to an increase of 9.7% or 92p and representing an annual pay increase of £1,600 to the average full-time worker. As wages continue to rise, the changes to tax thresholds will leave millions paying higher levels of tax.</p>

<p>Despite the Chancellor claiming tax as a proportion of income will rise by just 1% over the next five years, statistics from the OBR show that tax as a proportion of GDP is likely to be at the highest level for more than 70 years.</p>

<p><strong>Energy bills</strong></p>

<p>The Energy Price Guarantee (EGP) which currently caps household bills at £2,500, is set to rise to £3,000 in April, with the cap staying in place until 2024. For businesses, increasing energy costs will lead to increased overheads and tightening of customer purse strings, adding to the mounting pressure many SMEs are already feeling. According to The Chancellor, the Energy Price Guarantee (EPG) will be kept under review, and after April 2024 a new plan will be developed to protect consumers from energy price rises.</p>

<p>Whilst there are steps being taken to decrease our reliance on importing energy, which will eventually reduce prices, these measures are too far in the future for businesses to feel a difference, and further support will be required to manage rising costs.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p><strong>So, what does this mean for UK businesses?</strong></p>

<p>Although the Chancellor acknowledged that businesses need support to stay afloat during what is set to be a tough recession and put some measures in place to soften the blow, the Government’s ambitious consolidation plan will undoubtedly lead to turbulent times ahead. Whilst many UK businesses will warmly welcome the news of tax increases reaching bigger global firms, smaller businesses will feel the impact from today’s announcement the most.</p>

<p>The worsening cost of living crisis coupled with reduced pay packets and rising energy bills mean a drop in consumer spending is something of an inevitability. This will come as unwelcome news for many SMEs, who are already taking the brunt of this storm from all angles. For the Government’s consolidation plan to be effective, these new measures must be accompanied by initiatives that will support and stimulate consumer spending, whilst allowing businesses the legroom to invest in operations, to flatten the recession and encourage economic growth.</p>

<p>What is certain is that businesses will need the vital support of alternative lending to get them through the coming months. In times of financial hardship, the big banks and traditional lenders tend to start closing their doors to supporting businesses, tightening the belt and putting in much stricter lending criteria. Therefore, it's vital that alternative lending remains open for business.</p>

<p>At Time Finance, we work with some 10,000 business owners already, and while they navigate the current landscape, we know that they - and many more - need our services now more than ever.</p>]]></content>

		<updated><![CDATA[2022-11-21 10:19:36]]></updated>
		<content><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to finding a facility to suit the needs of your clients and their businesses, <a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance" href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance">an invoice finance solution is a popular way to boost cash flow while supporting ambitious growth plans.</a></p>

<p>These flexible funding solutions can quickly raise working capital (often as soon as 24 hours) from unpaid invoices, providing vital access to cash when overheads are looming.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, it's important to remember that there are many different types of invoice financing, known as <strong>invoice discounting and invoice factoring.</strong></p>

<p>But how do you know which is which? And <a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/time-blog/what-funding-stream-is-right-for-your-business" href="https://timefinance.com/time-blog/what-funding-stream-is-right-for-your-business">how can you decide which one is best for your client's requirements and goals?</a></p>

<p>In this guide, we'll give you everything you need to know about invoice financing for SMEs, touching on:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>What is invoice financing?&nbsp;</li>
	<li>What is the difference between invoice factoring and discounting?</li>
	<li>How do these solutions work?</li>
	<li>Which one is better for businesses?</li>
	<li>And much more!</li>
</ul>

<p>So, let's start by covering the basics.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h2><strong>What is invoice financing?</strong></h2>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>In a nutshell, an <a href="https://timefinance.com/time-blog/invoice-finance-for-smes">invoice finance facility allows businesses to borrow</a> against the value of their unpaid invoices.</p>

<p>This capital is accessed from outstanding invoices, producing an upfront payment of up to 90% of its value. This money can be put towards day-to-day costs, keeping pace with outgoing payments, or even used for new investments without dipping into savings.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The benefits of invoice financing include businesses getting paid faster for completed work and <a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/time-blog/the-importance-of-cashflow" href="https://timefinance.com/time-blog/the-importance-of-cashflow">not being held back by slow customer payments, which allows things to run much more smoothly.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>Another perk of invoice financing is its ability to allow businesses to expand their existing offerings or enter new markets earlier than expected, helping them achieve their goals much faster.</p>

<p>But how does this cash flow solution work in the real world?</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h2><strong>How does invoice financing work?</strong></h2>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>Invoice finance can be an effective way to secure an instant cash injection, which works by releasing funds against outstanding customer invoices. For businesses that operate within industries where payments are slow (or sometimes missed altogether), these forms of finance can unlock the value held in a sales ledger.</p>

<p>Our finance options allow businesses to access up to 90% of the value of their unpaid invoices in just 24 hours, which is sent straight to their accounts - minus our agreed fees.</p>

<p>At Time Finance, <a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/vision-and-values" href="https://timefinance.com/vision-and-values">our holistic approach allows us to create bespoke finance packages for each business.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>This means we frequently review the level of funding available, to ensure it's right for their plans in the immediate future and long term. We can also increase or decrease this level of funding to match their rate of growth as - and when - it's needed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p><strong>But what about those terms we touched on earlier?</strong></p>

<p>Don't worry, we haven't forgotten.</p>

<p>Invoice factoring and invoice discounting both sit neatly under the wider term of 'Invoice Finance' - so it's easy to get them mixed up.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Although the two concepts are fairly similar at first glance, there are some crucial things you need to consider before making a firm choice.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h2><strong>So, what are the differences between invoice factoring and discounting?</strong></h2>

<h2>
	<br>
</h2>

<p>To summarise, invoice financing is a method for businesses to borrow against their outstanding customer invoices as a short and medium-term borrowing option.</p>

<p>But you'll also need to know the two sub-products, known as ‘Invoice Discounting’ and ‘Factoring’.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Other terms for these products include ‘Disclosed Invoice Finance’ and ‘Confidential Invoice Discounting’, which we’ll touch on in more detail in the next section.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h3><strong>How does invoice factoring work?</strong></h3>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>Much like its sibling, <a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/invoice-factoring" href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/invoice-factoring">Invoice Factoring works by helping business owners access capital wrapped up in unpaid invoices.&nbsp;</a>However, it offers a much more 'hands-on' approach.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Invoice Factoring - also known as 'Disclosed Invoice Finance' - provides a solution that not only frees up to 90% of the value of these invoices but also gives SMEs more time to focus on their plans.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks to a fully-comprehensive credit control service, Disclosed Invoice Financing provides an <a href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/outsourced-credit-control">experienced credit control service</a> that will make contact with customers on behalf of the business. They will take the time to talk to their consumer base about their unpaid invoices, allowing SMEs to focus their efforts on growth plans and other opportunities instead.</p>

<p>This is especially helpful for smaller companies looking for a complete package of support for their sales ledgers while handling existing customer relationships.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As such, it's a popular pick for those who need a flexible service but do not currently have the internal facility for credit control procedures. It can also be a great way for companies to make sense of a large number of outstanding invoices while stabilising cash flow and establishing revenue.</p>

<h2>
	<br>
</h2>

<h2><strong>Is invoice discounting a good idea?</strong></h2>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>On the other hand, Invoice Discounting - also known as Confidential Invoice Discounting - offers all the faculties of a traditional invoice finance solution.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p><strong>But why is it classed as 'confidential'?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Unlike Invoice Factoring,<a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/invoice-discounting" href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/invoice-discounting">&nbsp;Discounting provides a cash advance without notifying customers that a structured finance facility has been deployed.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>Although it provides the same cash flow management opportunities, instead of utilising one of our controllers, all invoice management and customer communications will be kept within the business.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is a salient choice for those who already have internal credit control tools in use, allowing them to keep their financial operations discreet.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/time-blog/the-importance-of-cashflow" href="https://timefinance.com/time-blog/the-importance-of-cashflow">But how do you know which one will work best for a certain business?&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>We'll talk about this next.</p>

<h2>
	<br>
</h2>

<h2><strong>Invoice factoring VS invoice discounting</strong></h2>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>Essentially, <a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/clients/category/invoice-finance" href="https://timefinance.com/clients/category/invoice-finance">invoice discounting and invoice factoring are both ways to gain access to cash tied up in unpaid invoices.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>But there are a few clear distinctions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Invoice discounting works, for all intents and purposes, as funding taken out against these outstanding customer invoices, while invoice factoring offers a credit control facility that recoups these late payments on the business's behalf.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As such, invoice factoring means that SMEs don't have to chase their customers and can focus on more pressing operational matters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, invoice factoring offers further peace of mind while running their operations, as a dedicated controller is managing their credit control processes on their behalf. This can save the time and money that would otherwise have been spent on recruiting an in-house facility, allowing them to focus on more important acquisitions or investments.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As invoice discounting is a funding product, it means that this capital must be paid back - even if the customer still hasn't paid their invoice.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a result, this method is often used by larger companies to help cover a cashflow gap whenever it might occur, while invoice factoring is favoured by smaller enterprises.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But there is help available. For clients <a href="https://timefinance.com/time-blog/late-invoice-payments-what-to-do">concerned with the impact of late payments</a>, additional products like Bad Debt Protection can help. Available on a selective basis for flexible, tailored protection, Bad Debt Protection allows businesses to choose which customers they would like to cover - providing peace of mind and risk reduction when it counts.</p>

<p>You'll be able to make a decision based on your own knowledge and experience of your client's circumstances, as their needs will determine the best invoice financing solution.</p>

<p>But you'll also need to know the two sub-products, known as ‘Invoice Discounting’ and ‘Factoring’.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Other terms for these products include ‘Disclosed Invoice Finance’ and ‘Confidential Invoice Discounting’, which we’ll touch on in more detail in the next section.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h3><strong>How does invoice factoring work?</strong></h3>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>Much like its sibling, <a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/invoice-factoring" href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/invoice-factoring">Invoice Factoring works by helping business owners access capital wrapped up in unpaid invoices.&nbsp;</a>However, it offers a much more 'hands-on' approach.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Invoice Factoring - also known as 'Disclosed Invoice Finance' - provides a solution that not only frees up to 90% of the value of these invoices but also gives SMEs more time to focus on their plans.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks to a fully-comprehensive credit control service, Disclosed Invoice Financing provides an <a href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/outsourced-credit-control">experienced credit control service</a> that will make contact with customers on behalf of the business. They will take the time to talk to their consumer base about their unpaid invoices, allowing SMEs to focus their efforts on growth plans and other opportunities instead.</p>

<p>This is especially helpful for smaller companies looking for a complete package of support for their sales ledgers while handling existing customer relationships.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As such, it's a popular pick for those who need a flexible service but do not currently have the internal facility for credit control procedures. It can also be a great way for companies to make sense of a large number of outstanding invoices while stabilising cash flow and establishing revenue.</p>

<h2>
	<br>
</h2>

<h2><strong>Is invoice discounting a good idea?</strong></h2>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>On the other hand, Invoice Discounting - also known as Confidential Invoice Discounting - offers all the faculties of a traditional invoice finance solution.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p><strong>But why is it classed as 'confidential'?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Unlike Invoice Factoring,<a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/invoice-discounting" href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/invoice-discounting">&nbsp;Discounting provides a cash advance without notifying customers that a structured finance facility has been deployed.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>Although it provides the same cash flow management opportunities, instead of utilising one of our controllers, all invoice management and customer communications will be kept within the business.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is a salient choice for those who already have internal credit control tools in use, allowing them to keep their financial operations discreet.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/time-blog/the-importance-of-cashflow" href="https://timefinance.com/time-blog/the-importance-of-cashflow">But how do you know which one will work best for a certain business?&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>We'll talk about this next.</p>

<h2>
	<br>
</h2>

<h2><strong>Invoice factoring VS invoice discounting</strong></h2>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>Essentially, <a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/clients/category/invoice-finance" href="https://timefinance.com/clients/category/invoice-finance">invoice discounting and invoice factoring are both ways to gain access to cash tied up in unpaid invoices.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>But there are a few clear distinctions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Invoice discounting works, for all intents and purposes, as funding taken out against these outstanding customer invoices, while invoice factoring offers a credit control facility that recoups these late payments on the business's behalf.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As such, invoice factoring means that SMEs don't have to chase their customers and can focus on more pressing operational matters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, invoice factoring offers further peace of mind while running their operations, as a dedicated controller is managing their credit control processes on their behalf. This can save the time and money that would otherwise have been spent on recruiting an in-house facility, allowing them to focus on more important acquisitions or investments.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As invoice discounting is a funding product, it means that this capital must be paid back - even if the customer still hasn't paid their invoice.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a result, this method is often used by larger companies to help cover a cashflow gap whenever it might occur, while invoice factoring is favoured by smaller enterprises.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But there is help available. For clients <a href="https://timefinance.com/time-blog/late-invoice-payments-what-to-do">concerned with the impact of late payments</a>, additional products like Bad Debt Protection can help. Available on a selective basis for flexible, tailored protection, Bad Debt Protection allows businesses to choose which customers they would like to cover - providing peace of mind and risk reduction when it counts.</p>

<p>You'll be able to make a decision based on your own knowledge and experience of your client's circumstances, as their needs will determine the best invoice financing solution.</p>

		<content><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://timefinance.com/">Time Finance</a> has reached another lending milestone with the delivery of its largest day-one Invoice Finance facility, as it prepares to help more businesses in gaining access to flexible and supportive funding solutions.</p>

<p>The alternative finance provider to UK SMEs packaged and delivered the milestone £2million Invoice Finance facility to a long-established group of companies who manage site logistics and labour services. The money will be used to finance a new contract for a significant development in central London, in addition to providing core working capital.</p>

<p><strong>Phil Chesham, Managing Director of Invoice Finance at Time Finance, said:</strong> “Completing our largest new facility to date is a great achievement for Time Finance and one that further underlines the appetite we have to provide funding to businesses of all sizes.</p>

<p>“The existing clients we support often benefit from an uplift in their facility over the course of their time with us. While we have previously provided funding in excess of £2million, this is the first time we have supported a business with a facility of this size from the start.</p>

<p>“Our dedicated and expert-led teams play a key role in helping us to achieve these milestone figures. Not only do we offer a flexible and common-sense approach to lending, but our responsiveness and commitment to tailoring a solution that really supports our client’s specific needs is what sets Time Finance apart.”</p>

<p>Following fifteen consecutive months of growth in its own lending book, Time Finance announced in October <a href="https://timefinance.com/press-releases/time-finance-hits-145m-lending-milestone">a record high of £145 million supplied to businesses</a>. The company currently supports some 10,000 SMEs with a diverse range of financial solutions, including <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance">Invoice Finance</a>, <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/asset-finance">Asset Finance</a>, <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/loans">Business Loans,</a> and <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/vehicle-finance">Vehicle Finance</a>, as well as its new <a href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/asset-based-lending">Asset Based Lending</a> product.</p>

<p>The new milestone can be attributed to a rising demand for Invoice Finance solutions as well as Time Finance's flexibility in assisting firms in navigating current economic challenges and identifying opportunities for growth.</p>

<p>Time Finance is well-recognised within the commercial finance industry as a leading Invoice Finance provider. Earlier this year, Time Finance was awarded joint first position in Business Money’s Receivables Review of the Invoice Finance industry and more recently highly commended in the ‘Factor and Invoice Discounter of the Year’ and ‘Business Development Team of the Year’ categories in the NACFB Patron Awards.</p>]]></content>

		<title><![CDATA[2022: The year when British businesses fought back]]></title>
		<slug><![CDATA[2022-the-year-when-british-businesses-fought-back]]></slug>
		<published><![CDATA[2022-12-12 10:04:23]]></published>
		<updated><![CDATA[2022-12-12 10:04:23]]></updated>
		<content><![CDATA[<p align="center" style="text-align: left;"><em>&nbsp;</em>Looking back on the past year, it would be easy to mistake it as much longer than 12 months. The landscape for businesses has seemed to simultaneously stand still and constantly change against a backdrop of political uncertainty and rising costs. A rollercoaster &nbsp;of a year, no doubt, but one that has shown the true British spirit of our homegrown businesses. They are strong, resilient and this year has proven that.</p>

<p>What we have seen in 2022, more than anything, is that businesses have met the challenges of the past year head on. Agility in business is extremely valuable but in March 2020, it became essential. The lesson learnt over the course of 2020 and 2021 was to expect the unexpected; prepare to think on your feet. It’s almost as though during those years, businesses were in training for the uncertainty and surprises 2022 would bring.</p>

<p>It is impossible to look back over the past year and not take notice of the major shifts that have affected the UK economy. The past 12 months have seen three Prime Ministers and four Chancellors, the two most important roles in our country’s leadership. Those changes in personnel alone would be enough to unsteady the ship, but they also came with changes in policies, albeit some short-lived, that weakened our currency and our markets.</p>

<p>It takes some memory jogging to recall the then-Chancellor, Rishi Sunak’s, promises to businesses in the Spring Budget. At the time, he pledged that in six months his Autumn Statement would bring a package of measures to support business, cultivate innovation, boost productivity, and stimulate growth. Little did he know then that when the time came, he’d be Prime Minister overseeing an altogether different Autumn Statement focused on bringing down inflation and tackling continually rising costs.</p>

<p>At times this year, businesses have had to fight hard to be heard. In June, the Government’s newly appointed Cost of Living Tsar developed a campaign to ask SMEs to pledge to keep their costs down, a baffling move that drew widespread criticism. Without question, the Government needed to address the cost of living crisis, but putting this pressure on UK businesses - when they themselves are facing rising costs - seemed to solve one problem while exacerbating another. In fact, we surveyed our business community in July and found that 91% of SMEs were having to increase their prices in order to keep up with rising operational costs. That is not a choice that businesses take lightly.</p>

<p>The latter part of the year brought fresh urgency to the debate around climate change as world leaders gathered in Egypt for COP27. Taking place against a backdrop of the tragic war in Ukraine, COP27 was a stark reminder of global instability and our reliance on international energy sources, and the need to ramp up our investment in domestic supplies and renewable innovations. For many businesses, investment in sustainability will have never left the agenda. This time last year, our ‘Going Green for the Future’ campaign surveyed business owners and found that 70% had a plan to become more sustainable, but 12 months on 44% are now finding affordability to be the biggest barrier to seeing these plans through. Businesses have a tough balancing act to manage. Investing in skills, new equipment, operational efficiencies, marketing, and sustainability - to name just a few - is difficult when overheads continue to rise.</p>

<p>For our part, 2022 was the year in which we at Time Finance really ramped up our support for businesses. In times of economic turmoil, traditional lending becomes harder to access, and so we have listened to the businesses we work with and adapted products and services that meet their needs. In January, we launched a new Secured Loan offering, doubling from £250,000 to £500,000, and in May we launched Fast Track, giving businesses quicker access to Asset Finance solutions through a select network of broker partners.</p>

<p>More recently we launched our new Asset Based Lending solution, designed to help businesses unlock working capital by accessing funds otherwise tied up in assets. Through our new products and services, our aim is to give customers support across all areas of their business by offering a growing number of complementary products and services that can be used in conjunction with one another. We know that going into 2023, and the recession that is predicted to continue throughout the year, businesses will need somewhere to turn. The growth ambitions of so many businesses deserve to be realised no matter the challenges rumbling around us. We want to hear about, and be a part of, these ambitions; they are the key to our return to economic growth.</p>]]></content>

		<updated><![CDATA[2022-12-13 16:11:06]]></updated>
		<content><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://timefinance.com/">Time Finance</a> and <a href="https://www.goodmancorporate.com/">Goodman Corporate Finance</a> are pleased to announce that they have delivered £2million of funding support to a growing site logistics and labour supplier in the South East of England.</p>

<p>Goodman Corporate Finance, the business’ financial consultant, was brought in to help the client find an alternative Invoice Finance provider after the relationship with its Bank-owned funder deteriorated. After being introduced to Time Finance’s Invoice Finance team, the two funding partners successfully packaged and delivered the six-figure funding line, building in the necessary headroom for the client to continue taking on new contracts with confidence.</p>

<p>With the £2million funds in place, the new client has taken on a new contract for a major development in Central London and can continue to purchase materials and equipment required to co-ordinate site logistics, recruit temporary workers, and grow its pipeline of work.</p>

<p><strong>Stefan Radymski of Goodman Corporate Finance, said:</strong> “We are delighted to have been able to support this business with Time Finance’s support. It was a complex case from the start, with strict timescales requiring a funder to really under the skin of this business’ challenges and package a solution that covers contractual debt alongside typical invoiced work. Time Finance were able to step up to be that reliable and solution-driven funding provider.</p>

<p>“The whole process was managed professionally and efficiently from day one. We’re glad to see the client with the right funding partner by their side.”</p>

<p><a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance">Invoice Finance</a> can help SMEs drive their growth plans forward as well as support the everyday expenditure of running a business; including paying suppliers, HMRC, purchasing stock and materials, and paying employee wages. By releasing funds otherwise tied up in unpaid invoices, businesses are no longer held back by a lack of cashflow. With facilities ranging between £10,000 and £2.5million, Invoice Finance can help businesses of all sizes.</p>

<p><strong>Simon Holian, Business Development Manager at Time Finance, said:</strong> “Despite its complexities, we recognised a real opportunity to support a strong business with solid financials and ambitious growth plans. The team at Goodman Corporate Finance have been brilliant to work alongside from the outset. Their transparency around the deal and the business’ requirements enabled us to get comfortable with the deal and put in place a funding package that would support this client’s current financial needs and allow for future growth. It was a fantastic team effort, and we look forward to working together to support more businesses.”</p>

<p>Time Finance specialises in the provision of funding solutions to UK businesses seeking to access the finance they need to realise their growth plans. With a diverse portfolio that includes Asset Finance, Invoice Finance, Loans, and Vehicle Finance, businesses can select the best option for them or combine those facilities through its <a href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/asset-based-lending">recently established Asset Based Lending product</a>.</p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://timefinance.com/">Time Finance</a> is pleased to announce continued growth in its revenue and profit as its lending book reaches a new record high of £152.7million.</p>

<p>The company’s revenue was up 12% to £13.2million and Profit before Tax up 67% to £2million in the first six-months of its financial year to November 2022.</p>

<p>As a specialist provider of funding solutions, Time Finance works with financial intermediaries and their business owner clients to deliver <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/asset-finance">Asset Finance</a>, <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance">Invoice Finance</a>, Business Loan and Vehicle Finance solutions, in addition to its newly launched Asset Based Lending offering. The firm supports some 10,000 business owners in the UK.</p>

<p>The announcement reflects the resilience of the firm’s offering as it continues to invest in its proposition to the market and has been further fuelled by an increased demand for finance as businesses of all sizes turn to supportive funding solutions to tackle current economic challenges.</p>

<p><strong>Chief Executive Officer, Ed Rimmer comments:</strong> “It’s great to see the performance of the first half of our financial year marking a further record high for Time Finance. Our renewed strategy to dedicate a real drive toward boosting our lending to UK businesses is further demonstrated by these figures, the strength of our lending model and our business strategy.</p>

<p>“The growing demand for finance we continue to experience certainly plays a part in contributing to this positive trading momentum, but it’s the investments we have made to both our teams and operations over the last year that have enabled us to take the business from strength to strength. The next 6 months will see Time Finance continue to look for innovative ways to inspire confidence and growth in the SME market and increase our support to UK businesses.”</p>

<p>The positive trading announcement is released ahead of Time Finance’s unaudited interim results in January which expects to see more momentum as the firm focuses on bolstering its secured lending proposition and packaging larger deals for UK SMEs.</p>]]></content>

		<published><![CDATA[2023-01-04 15:57:47]]></published>
		<updated><![CDATA[2023-01-04 15:57:47]]></updated>
		<content><![CDATA[<p>New data from <a href="https://timefinance.com/about-us">Time Finance</a> has shown that half of UK SMEs are anticipated to invest in sustainability in 2023 as pressure mounts for businesses to cut their carbon emissions in-line with the Government’s 2050 Net Zero targets.</p>

<p>Exploring the financial support businesses will need to achieve their sustainability ambitions, the survey found that 50% said that businesses will invest more time and money into a greener strategy following COP27 and its stark reminders of the fight against climate change.</p>

<p>Time Finance is sharing its data ahead of the anticipated announcement from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) detailing the outcomes of its Net Zero Review, the results of which are expected to give businesses clearer direction on their path to Net Zero.</p>

<p><strong>Ed Rimmer, CEO at Time Finance, said:</strong> “The role of alternative finance is to understand and facilitate the growth ambitions of businesses, to work with them to ensure they have access to the most beneficial forms of finance to enable investment. We can clearly see that businesses have a strong commitment to the sustainability agenda, made all the more pressing following COP27. What we need to do now is ensure that businesses have access to the finance they need to bring these plans to life.”</p>

<p>Despite the widespread ambition amongst businesses to improve sustainability, Time Finance’s survey also found that more than 40% of those surveyed believe affordability will be a barrier to green investment.</p>

<p><strong>Ed continued:</strong> “Our recent survey shows us that our customers are as committed, if not more so, to their sustainability strategies than ever, but their commitment is not without concern and caution. We conducted a similar survey 12 months ago to understand how COP26 had influenced businesses’ feelings towards the climate change agenda. What we found was that commitment was strong but a 67% majority didn’t think there was sufficient Government support to help small businesses adopt greener technologies or business practices. Skip forward a year and affordability is still the number one barrier for businesses to become more sustainable.</p>

<p>“Businesses that are tuned in to the UK’s net zero ambitions will be waiting to hear from BEIS on the results of their recent Net Zero Review. The Government is still very much committed to its 2050 Net Zero target but businesses need to see the substance behind the promise that this will be achieved in a ‘pro-business’ and ‘pro-growth’ manner.</p>

<p>“As providers of alternative finance solutions, it is vitally important to our work to understand what businesses need. Unlocking working capital enables all manner of investments and knowing the areas of focus for businesses in 2023 enables us to respond in ways they need, allowing them to achieve their growth ambitions but doing so while juggling such priorities as sustainability.”</p>

<p>Time Finance supports more than 10,000 UK businesses every year with flexible and supportive funding solutions. The alternative finance provider specialises in the provision of funding solutions to UK businesses seeking to access the finance they need to realise their growth plans, with a diverse portfolio that includes <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/asset-finance">Asset Finance</a>, <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance">Invoice Finance</a>, <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/loans">Business Loans</a>, and its recently established <a href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/asset-based-lending">Asset Based Lending</a> product.</p>]]></content>

		<title><![CDATA[2023: A close eye on cashflow and a renewed focus for the future]]></title>
		<slug><![CDATA[2023-a-close-eye-on-cashflow-and-a-renewed-focus-for-the-future]]></slug>
		<published><![CDATA[2023-01-06 15:24:08]]></published>
		<updated><![CDATA[2023-01-06 15:24:08]]></updated>
		<content><![CDATA[<p align="center" style="text-align: left;"><strong><em>Ed Rimmer, Chief Executive Officer at Time Finance,&nbsp;</em></strong><em>shares his predictions on what 2023 will bring for businesses and the key trends to expect this year.</em><em>&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>As businesses close the door on a year that brought them challenge after challenge – from soaring energy costs, workforce shortages, political instability, inflation, and supply chain disruptions – a new year brings new opportunities and the chance to embrace a fresh start.</p>

<p>SMEs up and down the country showed a defiant response to those challenges, and whilst economic growth slowed and predictions of an impending recession loomed, confidence remained high. So much so that moving into 2023, our Time Finance Business Barometer Survey found that 82% of business owners are feeling optimistic going into the next 12 months.</p>

<p>What this tells us is that in the face of hardship, businesses find solutions to survive and thrive against the odds. Whilst this optimism and outlook places us on a strong footing for the next year, we know too well that access to the right finance solutions can mean the difference between a business sliding backwards, standing still, or pushing forward. With a renewed focus for the future and an ambition to succeed, here’s what we anticipate seeing from businesses this year…</p>

<p><strong>Keeping a close watch on cashflow</strong></p>

<p>Having dealt with unpredictability at every corner in 2022, businesses have learned to stay on their toes. But simply reacting to new challenges as they arise isn’t a sustainable long-term business strategy. Having the financial headroom to not only mitigate those risks but grasp hold of new opportunities for growth however, is.</p>

<p>As the future remains uncertain, both financial brokers and businesses alike will be looking for creative solutions from their funders, to release working capital and gain access to additional finance. Whether it’s through re-financing existing equipment, releasing money from unpaid customer invoices, gaining access to an instant cash injection, or all the above, there are a number of funding solutions ready to help businesses manage that all-important cashflow throughout 2023.</p>

<p><strong>Investing for the future</strong></p>

<p>Keeping an eye on cashflow is of course a necessity, but a forward-thinking business leader will always look to the future. They will have one eye on restoring cash in the business and another on bringing forward their investment plans. Whether it’s creating products or services, entering new markets, or implementing innovations to transform the way they do things. All of that requires investment.</p>

<p>Our research finds that half of businesses will prioritise investment in operations and technology in 2023, closely followed by one in five SMEs looking to invest in new products and services, one in five expanding in their workforce and bringing in new talent, with a further one in ten prioritising securing new equipment this year.</p>

<p><strong>Stabilising the supply chain</strong></p>

<p>The importance of a stable and supportive supply chain really hit home in 2022 and we expect this is to remain a key trend for 2023 as businesses brace for further disruption this year. Soaring expenses, along with increasing difficulty in obtaining the essential stock and supplies to conduct business, will continue to impact the bottom line if solutions are not put in place swiftly.</p>

<p>Access to finance will support the strategy to add stability to their supply chain, giving businesses the funding boost needed to invest in new partnerships with other suppliers. For those facing the challenge of rising costs, having the financial freedom to negotiate payment terms with their suppliers can ensure a positive cashflow is maintained.</p>

<p><strong>Going green for the future</strong></p>

<p>The Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) strategy of a company is increasingly crucial as its accountability to customers grows. By the end of 2022, our Going Green study indicated that a significant 70% of customers claimed that a company's commitment to sustainability influenced their decision to buy from them. So, when it comes to increasing sales and expanding a consumer base, sustainability should undoubtedly be a priority.</p>

<p>COP27 brought the urgency of climate change into sharp focus at the end of 2022, and with the Government’s 2050 Net Zero target not far off the horizon, more and more businesses will be focused on investing in and implementing green initiatives in 2023.</p>

<p><strong>Time to embrace a new year</strong></p>

<p>Whatever the focus for businesses this year, it is apparent that there is a lot of opportunity waiting to be seized, and that access to finance will be critical in bringing those plans to fruition. The hardships of 2022 will undoubtedly continue, but with a new year comes newfound energy, concentration, and drive. With that and the assistance of a supportive funder by their side, 2023 can be the year for businesses to help turn the tide for the UK economy.</p>]]></content>

		<slug><![CDATA[7-in-10-customers-are-influenced-by-a-businesses-green-credentials]]></slug>
		<published><![CDATA[2023-01-26 09:09:50]]></published>
		<updated><![CDATA[2023-01-26 09:09:50]]></updated>
		<content><![CDATA[<p>New data from Time Finance has shed light on the rise of conscious consumerism as it finds 82% of customers believe it is important for businesses to have green credentials, and 70% claim their sustainability commitment influences their decision to buy from them.</p>

<p>As part of its annual Going Green Survey, the new figures from Time Finance highlight the increasing obligation businesses have to their customers and the impact this has on their subsequent investment choices in 2023. 50% of businesses told the alternative finance provider that they plan to invest more time and money into their green strategy this year.</p>

<p>Emphasising the value of investing in green initiatives to remain competitive, the new data shows a marked increase in the perceived importance for businesses operating more sustainably. In January 2022, this was considered a priority for just 45% of respondents, compared to 82% 12 months on.</p>

<p>The new data comes ahead of the anticipated release of the Government’s review of its 2050 Net Zero target, which is expected to provide clarity on how the UK - particularly businesses - can reduce carbon emissions in a ‘pro-business’ and ‘pro-growth’ manner.</p>

<p><strong>Ed Rimmer, CEO at Time Finance, said:</strong> “There is a growing responsibility for businesses to operate more sustainably, particularly given the Government’s ambitious target to achieve Net Zero by 2050. We can see that this is increasingly reflected in buying behaviours with the majority of businesses and consumers now choosing to buy from businesses that are taking steps to reduce their impact on the environment.</p>

<p>“With statistics like these, businesses can’t afford not to invest in their sustainability. But it needn’t come at the cost of their other investment priorities. There are many funding opportunities available to assist businesses; whether they are looking to secure new, more environmentally friendly equipment, revamp processes to reduce carbon emissions or have the funds to enter into new relationships with greener supply chain partners.</p>

<p>“Times remain tough, and few businesses are in the fortunate position of drawing on spare cash to invest in sustainability which is where funders like Time Finance can come in. Remaining competitive, against a backdrop of economic challenges, will be vital to a business’ survival and success in 2023, so it is essential that they have the confidence and the financial support to invest in their future.”<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

		<content><![CDATA[<p>New data from Time Finance reveals that one in three businesses see effective monitoring of their impact on the environment to be the most crucial step in building a more sustainable future.</p>

<p>The findings form part of Time Finance’s annual Going Green survey which looks to uncover progress and priorities behind UK businesses’ environmental, social and governance (ESG) commitments, as more firms turn to alternative finance to support their green investments.</p>

<p>‘Tracking progress’ was ranked the top priority for delivering an effective sustainability strategy this year, followed by ‘engaging employees’ for 26% of business owners, ‘defining a mission and values’ as well as ‘setting targets’ for 21%.</p>

<p>The spotlight on sustainability and the target to become Net Zero by 2050 has encouraged both businesses and consumers to become more conscious of their purchasing decisions, with 70% now considering a business’ green footprint in their buying process. As a result, half of UK SMEs are anticipated to invest in their sustainability strategy in 2023 as pressure mounts to report their carbon emissions.</p>

<p><strong>Ed Rimmer, CEO at Time Finance, said:</strong> “The importance of sustainability has the potential to create a real shift in businesses’ focus for 2023 and subsequently, their investment plans. We already know that 50% of SMEs will prioritise investment in operations and technology this year, and what this data reveals is a clear opportunity for them to explore investment opportunities which help them to bring in effective monitoring processes and technology.</p>

<p>“These findings, whilst promising, come against the backdrop of rising costs and for many, concerns around affordability may hold them back from not only making investments in their monitoring processes, but also in energy-efficient equipment and machinery, or resource and personnel.</p>

<p>“Ensuring that businesses have access to finance helps to maintain this momentum and give businesses the confidence to put their sustainability strategy higher up the agenda. Whether that’s by enabling investment in new technology, systems or machinery through <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/asset-finance">asset finance</a>, or simply injecting working capital into the business through <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance">invoice finance</a> or <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/loans">business loans</a>.</p>

<p>“Alternative finance has a valuable role to play in businesses’ plans to adopt greener technologies and tracking their progress to a more sustainable future. It is a huge priority and one that, with effective finance, needn’t come at the cost of other investment priorities.”</p>

<p>Time Finance supports more than 10,000 UK businesses every year with flexible and supportive funding solutions. <a href="https://timefinance.com/time-blog/alternative-financing-explained">The alternative finance provider </a>specialises in the provision of funding solutions to UK businesses seeking to access the finance they need to realise their growth plans, with a diverse portfolio that includes <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/asset-finance">Asset Finance</a>, <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance">Invoice Finance</a>, <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/loans">Business Loans</a>, and its recently established <a href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/asset-based-lending">Asset Based Lending</a> solution.</p>]]></content>

		<title><![CDATA[The Ultimate Guide to Cashflow Financing]]></title>
		<slug><![CDATA[cashflow-finance]]></slug>
		<published><![CDATA[2023-02-10 09:09:02]]></published>
		<updated><![CDATA[2023-02-10 09:09:02]]></updated>
		<content><![CDATA[<p>Everyone knows that cash flow is one of the most important things to consider when running a business - but what about cash flow financing and funding?</p>

<p>In this guide,&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/our-team" href="https://timefinance.com/our-team">our team of experts will give you the ins and outs of this finance option.</a></p>

<p>We'll look at the basis of its financial terms, which businesses can use it, and the benefits. This guide will also take a closer look at the different types of cash flow, seeing which ones can help form the basis of this dynamic solution.</p>

<p>Let's get started!</p>

<h3>
	<br>
</h3>

<h3><strong>Cash Flow Finance: at a glance</strong></h3>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>Cashflow financing can help companies structure solutions that can help out when cash is usually tight.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the day-to-day running of a business, we know that larger overheads or issues such as late payments can <a href="https://timefinance.com/time-blog/cash-flow-issues-in-business">cause problems for the internal flow of cash</a>.</p>

<p>As such, cashflow financing can aid business growth in the present and supplement investment in operations for the future, by providing funding support by leveraging future cash flow.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Working capital can be unlocked from a lender, such as Time Finance, providing a little more financial breathing room. This can be used to ensure outgoing factors, such as suppliers, employees and HMRC are paid in a timely manner - while offering room for growth and investment.</p>

<p>Many businesses looking to expand their existing offering or enter new markets find invoice financing especially handy, as it can propel them to achieve these goals earlier than expected.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>
	<br>
</h2>

<h2><strong>What do we mean by cash flow?</strong></h2>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>Making sure you have enough cash for outgoing expenses - regardless of whether your business is profitable - is an important aspect of running a business.</p>

<p>As such,&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/time-blog/the-importance-of-cashflow" href="https://timefinance.com/time-blog/the-importance-of-cashflow">a positive cash flow is one of the most crucial parts of keeping things moving.</a> But what do we actually mean by this?&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a nutshell, 'cash flow' is the complete amount of cash that is being plugged in - and out - of a company (hence the 'flow!'). Ensuring that the levels of cash are at optimum levels is how many companies are able to continue normal business operations, as shortages or cash flow issues can have major repercussions - especially when it comes to paying staff or suppliers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are many different ways that business cashflow can occur.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These are usually credited as three sources, which are:&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Cash From Operations</strong></p>

<p>When it comes to a business’ cash flow statement, the first thing that is listed is usually ‘Cash Flow from Operating Activities’ - or CFO. This shows the amount of money brought in from everyday, regular business activities, such as the production of goods or sales.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Cash From Investing</strong></p>

<p>Also listed on a cash flow statement is money raised from investing activities (or CFI). This logs long-term uses of cash, through the sale or purchase of a fixed asset like equipment or property. Money made from the sale of a split, merger or acquisition will also fall into this category.</p>

<p><strong>Cash From Finances&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>‘Cash flow from Financing Activities’, or CFF, simply depicts the net flows of cash that is actually being used to fund the business.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Debt, equity, and dividend transactions are all part of these financing activities, which provides investors with insight into how strong a company is financially. It also lets them know if a business’ capital structure is managed optimally.</p>

<h3>
	<br>
</h3>

<h3><strong>How does cash flow impact this particular finance practice?</strong></h3>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>Cash flow finance is often used by businesses to access additional working capital, helping them keep up with existing financial commitments without having to stunt their internal cashflow.</p>

<p>This can also be used flexibly, with obtained capital also helping to bridge gaps in operations, such as managing overheads and new acquisitions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When it comes to lending, a funder can dispense capital by looking at a 'prospective statement of cash flow'.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is because a company is usually borrowing from a chunk of their future cash flows that they are hoping to produce, with lenders basing a payment schedule based around this expected cash inflow.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here at Time Finance, we also analyse the historical cost of sales and flows to secure their investment, offering the business an amount based on their past and predicted findings.</p>

<h2>
	<br>
</h2>

<h2><strong>Why is there a need for cash flow statements?</strong></h2>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>Essentially, cash flow statements can help businesses to understand and track exactly where their money is being spent. This can provide a little extra clarity when it comes to staying on top of financial commitments, assisting owners in making informative decisions that’s based on reviewing historical data and cash flow forecasting.</p>

<p>All cash flow is reported on a business's<a data-mce-href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashflowstatement.asp" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashflowstatement.asp">&nbsp;cash flow statement (CFS),</a> which actively records a company's net income or profit for a set period of time.</p>

<p>These cash flow statements are especially handy when it comes to supporting applications for finance through lenders like Time Finance - whereby a report of incomings, outgoings, projected forecasts for the future are essential when raising capital</p>

<h2>
	<br>
</h2>

<h2><strong>What about projecting future cash flows?</strong></h2>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>Of course, lenders can't just take historical factors into account. They need to look at a company's receivables - which are payments such as outstanding invoices owed from customers - and are usually collected anywhere between a month or three months in the future.</p>

<p>As a result, accounts receivables represent future cash flows from today's sales. To estimate how much cash will be generated in the future, lenders like Time Finance can estimate how much receivables will be collected.</p>

<p>Accounts payable, which include money due to suppliers and other short-term debt obligations, must also be accounted for by a lender. Cash flow forecasting can be done by calculating the net cash generated from receivables and payables, with the lenders like Time Finance determining the funding amount based on how much cash is generated.</p>

<p>However, lenders might have their own guidelines on what’s needed for businesses to be approved for cash flow financing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Other factors, such as outstanding debt and credit rating requirements also come into play, which will have to be assessed before the value of a loan is released.</p>

<h2>
	<br>
</h2>

<h2><strong>Spot the difference: asset based lending VS cash flow financing&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>Although the two may cross circles, <a href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/asset-based-lending-solutions">cash flow financing is different from other asset-based lending solutions</a>, such as an asset-backed loan.</p>

<p><a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/asset-based-lending" href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/asset-based-lending">An asset-based loan is a method of borrowing money that enables companies to use an asset listed on a balance sheet</a> as collateral against the loan itself. It does this by using multiple forms of finance - such as an invoice finance solution or a business loan - to raise capital from within the company.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One aspect of this asset can be equipment, inventory, machinery, invoices or property.</p>

<p>In a similar way, cash flow financing uses the proceeds of the business as collateral for the loan.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cash flow financing, however, doesn't make use of tangible or fixed assets. This means that the collateral, which is the projected proceeds from cash flow, is what secures the value of the loan.</p>

<p>As a result,&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/clients/category/asset-based-lending" href="https://timefinance.com/clients/category/asset-based-lending">asset-based finance is often used by businesses with a lot of equipment and valuable assets,</a> while cash flow financing is typically used by businesses with a high cash turnover but little physical equipment.</p>

<h2>
	<br>
</h2>

<h2><strong>What are the benefits of cash flow financing?</strong></h2>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>There are many reasons why businesses would opt for this form of finance - which is why we've made it easy to see why it might appeal in this handy list.</p>

<p><strong>Longer and flexible terms:</strong> Cash flow loans can often be structured between 5 to 7 years and are tailored to the borrower's bespoke requirements. A balloon payment is typically used to postpone repayment or lessen the monthly amount, but this may depend on the lender's discretion.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Less collateral needed</strong> - Compared to other loans and <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/asset-finance">asset finance solutions</a>, cash flow loans are typically backed by cash flow statements or are unsecured loans themselves. They will extend their lending without the need of expensive physical assets or equipment as a lien, providing businesses with important financing to support expansion and growth.&nbsp;</p>

		<content><![CDATA[<p align="center" style="text-align: left;">As business insolvencies reach a 13-year high, we sit down with our <strong>Managing Director of&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance"><strong>Invoice Finance</strong></a><strong>, Phil Chesham</strong>, to discuss the road to recovery and how alternative finance can be the key to preventing more viable businesses from going under in 2023.</p>

<p><strong>Running a business is a challenge in itself</strong></p>

<p>There’s no doubt that starting and running a business is no easy feat. It takes a great deal of effort, dedication, and hard work to make it a success. On top of the everyday challenges of running a business, 2022 gave firms high inflation, soaring costs, supply chain challenges and weakening consumer demand to contend with. This was on top of post pandemic recovery and the repayment of many Covid-19 support initiatives.</p>

<p>More and more firms are struggling to make ends meet, and unfortunately for many, these pressures have meant that insolvency has been the inevitable outcome of an unsustainable situation. The figures are staggering; insolvencies reached a 13-year high at the end of January and 22,000 businesses were forced to fold last year.</p>

<p><strong>It’s more than just rising costs holding businesses back</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://timefinance.com/time-blog/cash-flow-issues-in-business">Poor cash flow is not a new problem</a>; it hasn’t arisen because of the rising cost of doing business, although it’s definitely made it worse. <a href="https://timefinance.com/time-blog/late-invoice-payments-what-to-do">Issues such as delayed or late payments</a> from customers have long acted as a key barrier for businesses, but this is a challenge that is only further compounded by the newer issue of rising overheads. Acting as a vicious cycle, the late payment culture sees one business owed thousands in outstanding invoices. They in-turn struggle to pay their own suppliers, and the domino effect continues forcing those suppliers to be without the cash in the bank to pay their own invoices, and on and on the problem continues.</p>

<p>The significance and scale of this is not something that can be easily ignored. From conducting our own research, we’ve seen businesses owed up to £250,000 in late payments and up to 70% waiting longer than 60 days to be paid. That’s too many businesses in need of working capital, headroom, and a freedom to grow. Across the UK, this figure is much more bleak with estimations that late payments amount to £23.4 billion. Let’s just think about the potential those billions of pounds could unlock if it was paid to those businesses on time.</p>

<p><strong>It’s time to think about more than just survival</strong></p>

<p>22,000 businesses going under in 2023 is a worrying statistic but what we need to consider is which of these insolvencies could have been prevented if firms had the right financial support in place. And we’re not necessarily talking simply about survival here. <a href="https://timefinance.com/time-blog/alternative-financing-explained">The role of alternative finance</a> is to help businesses achieve their growth potential, to <a href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/working-capital-loans">help them access working capital</a> and bring forward investment plans. Yes, an injection of finance can help pay the bills but it can also enable businesses to grow their capabilities, and expand their earning potential. It can take them from simply surviving to thriving. Having a healthy margin of working capital in a business can allow a business to invest in its people, innovate through new technologies, adapt and develop products and services, and break into new markets. Businesses that prosper are businesses that adapt.</p>

<p><strong>Unlocking capital through invoice finance</strong></p>

<p>A business seeking finance for growth can look no further than its own revenue, and this is the beauty of invoice finance. There is a misconception that invoice finance is a failsafe when cash is low - a solution to unpaid invoices that helps make ends meet. It does do this, but that only scratches the surface of its potential. With an invoice finance facility in place, a business ensures it has enough cash reserves to pay the bills while building in extra headroom to see through investment plans. In this sense, it can be an extremely valuable tool for growth.</p>

<p>Of course, there is an argument that <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance">financial services like invoice finance</a> simply shouldn’t be needed. If all invoices were paid on time, then businesses would have greater stability, more control over their cashflow, and they would be able to forecast investments and growth plans. In January 2021, the Government reformed its Prompt Payment Code with that exact aim in mind, however just two years later it has made little difference and there is currently another Government review into late payment to help address the billions owed to small businesses. Any step to address this issue is a step in the right direction, but while this debate rumbles on, the challenges remain for businesses. We believe in providing the solution, to ensure that viable businesses are given the best chance to survive and thrive.</p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Are Late Invoice Payments holding your clients back? Here’s what to do…</strong></h2>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>When it comes to late invoice payments, we know that business owners often feel like they are stepping on eggshells. Trying to balance the books with optimal cash flow situation while maintaining relationships with customers is a tricky act at the best of times, <a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/press-releases/late-payment-debt-as-high-as-200000-for-1-in-5-smes" href="https://timefinance.com/press-releases/late-payment-debt-as-high-as-200000-for-1-in-5-smes">especially when outstanding invoices are playing havoc with paying suppliers or keeping up with HMRC.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>The good news is that there are a number of things that enterprises can do to give their businesses some much-needed breathing room when it comes to overdue payments.</p>

<p>In this guide,<a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/our-team" href="https://timefinance.com/our-team">&nbsp;our team of experts will give you an overview of the impact of unpaid invoices, as well as provide tips and financial solutions to help bridge the gap.</a></p>

<p>So let's get into it!</p>

<h2>
	<br>
</h2>

<h2><strong>Which businesses do unpaid invoices affect?&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>Of course, any business is going to struggle if they are constantly putting up with late payments. But in this instance, those who repeatedly fall foul of this issue tend to be SMEs that rely on invoices as part of daily operations and their provision of services.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/press-releases/1-in-3-businesses-see-late-payment-as-one-of-their-biggest-threats-to-survival" href="https://timefinance.com/press-releases/1-in-3-businesses-see-late-payment-as-one-of-their-biggest-threats-to-survival">With one in three enterprises seeing late payments as one of their biggest threats to survival,</a> understanding how to tackle these - without harming customer relationships - is a crucial part of building business confidence.</p>

<p>This is prevalent within industries and sectors that rely on B2B invoices as part of their ingoings and outgoings, such as:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Manufacturing</li>
	<li>Recruitment</li>
	<li>Printing</li>
	<li>Wholesale</li>
	<li>Haulage and Transport</li>
	<li>Construction</li>
	<li>Security Services</li>
</ul>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>Essentially, if a business regularly trades with other businesses, or relies on getting an invoice on time, then late payments can cause huge gaps within internal operations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>From cash flow instability to causing looming overheads, waiting on late payments can cause plenty of problems - and additional stress.</p>

<p>At Time Finance, we know it can be difficult for businesses to chase payment themselves, especially while maintaining a good customer relationship, which is crucial for future endeavours.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But not everyone has the in-house facility to keep tabs on overdue invoices - especially if there are multiple - which can quickly become a headache alongside the day-to-day strains of running a business.</p>

<p>However, there are financial solutions designed to assist with this particular issue - which is where we come in.</p>

<p>Read on to find out more.</p>

<h2>
	<br>
</h2>

<h2><strong>Sound familiar? An Invoice Finance solution can prove to be helpful.</strong></h2>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>Overdue invoices prove a major challenge for businesses.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That's why invoice financing is designed to be a short to medium-term borrowing solution that helps enterprises get much-needed access to the value of their outstanding invoice balance.</p>

<p>But invoice Finance solutions come in a few shapes and sizes, so there's a financial product that will likely suit your client's business and their unique needs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At Time Finance, we offer two products that fall under the umbrella of Invoice Finance, designed to release cash quickly from unpaid invoices.</p>

<p>These are known as '<a href="https://www.timefinance.com/finance-products/invoice-factoring">Invoice Factoring</a>' and 'Invoice Discounting',<a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance" href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance">&nbsp;but are more commonly termed 'Disclosed Invoice Finance' and 'Confidential Invoice Discounting'.</a> These offer slightly different ways of dealing with outstanding payments.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>
	<br>
</h3>

<h3>Invoice Discounting</h3>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p><a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/disclosed-confidential-invoice-finance" href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/disclosed-confidential-invoice-finance">When businesses need a quick 'cash injection' - up to the value of 90% of their sales ledger - then 'Confidential Invoice Discounting' is able to help.</a> With this particular solution, it's important to remember that a company's customer base is not notified that a lender, such as Time Finance, is involved - which is handy when business owners are keen to keep communications and other financial procedures both in-house and discreet.</p>

<p>As a result, it's great for businesses that already have a credit control function in place, and are able to facilitate actions of this kind - keeping things on the down-low while getting to the crux of the issue.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We are happy to help you determine which type of financial assistance is best for you and your client's business. All you have to do is get in touch with our expert team and we can get the ball rolling.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>
	<br>
</h3>

<h3>Invoice Factoring</h3>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p><a href="https://www.timefinance.com/finance-products/invoice-factoring">Invoice factoring can certainly help businesses</a> access the value of their outstanding invoices if they need some assistance.</p>

<p><a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/disclosed-confidential-invoice-finance" href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/disclosed-confidential-invoice-finance">Invoice Factoring, also known as ‘Disclosed Invoice Finance’,</a> allows businesses to unlock up to 90% of the value of their unpaid invoices within just 24 hours of it being raised - much like our other invoice finance solutions.</p>

<p>At Time Finance, 'Disclosed Invoice Finance' gives businesses access to a dedicated and experienced credit controller, who will be able to make regular contact with customers on their behalf.</p>

<p>Combined with a comprehensive credit control service, this product gives businesses a little extra breathing space, by freeing up their time through rerouting customer communication about outstanding invoices.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is handled by our experienced, professional and friendly credit controllers, which gives businesses the chance to refocus discussions on new and exciting opportunities instead.</p>

<p>Businesses that require more support with their sales ledgers can harness this bespoke service, all while managing those crucial customer relationships without the business owner needing to be involved.&nbsp;</p>

		<content><![CDATA[<p>Businesses need to keep capital moving throughout their operations in order to fulfil their orders, provide services, manage suppliers, and pay staff.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So what happens when a cash flow problem gets in the way?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Although it seems that the ultimate indicator of a successful business might be making a healthy profit margin, ensuring that there's a steady flow of cash on a day-to-day basis is vital to the overall survival - and growth - of a business.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But don't worry. If a company is experiencing cash flow issues, there are some things that business owners can do to get things running smoothly again.</p>

<p>In this blog,&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/our-team" href="https://timefinance.com/our-team">the Time Finance team will be able to give you the full lowdown on what late payments can do to cash reserves and outflows.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>We'll talk about some of the main impacts on business cash flow, as well as signposting useful tips and financial solutions that should be able to help.</p>

<p>Need some guidance on what causes issues in cash flow? We can help.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Let's dive in.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>
	<br>
</h2>

<h2><strong>What is a Company Cash Flow Problem?</strong></h2>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>Cash flow difficulties can look very different depending on the business.</p>

<p><a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/time-blog/the-importance-of-cashflow" href="https://timefinance.com/time-blog/the-importance-of-cashflow">But more often than not, an inability to make payments to suppliers, pay bills, or run the business effectively indicates a cash flow problem</a> - which in a nutshell, is a tricky situation where the cash going out of the company exceeds cash coming in.</p>

<p>Poor cash flow is quite telling, as it is usually seen as one of the main factors that indicate whether a company is 'doing well' or struggling. That's because the flow of capital can impact most parts of an enterprise's internal - and external - operations.</p>

<p>A healthier cash flow is often a sign of success, but you'd be surprised at the number of businesses that are 'doing well' that might have issues, or are managing things ineffectively.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Many people think that if a business's outgoings are significantly higher than the outgoings, everything is running as it should - on paper, that is.</p>

<p>In reality, there are a number of things that can cause a cash flow shortfall.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We'll touch on this next.</p>

<h2>
	<br>
</h2>

<h2><strong>What are the main causes of cash flow problems?</strong></h2>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>Even profitable businesses can fall foul of common cash flow problems - many of which are out of the owner's control.</p>

<p>We most commonly see these kinds of issues in businesses that rely on invoices in order to keep capital moving, usually from business to business, in order to fulfil orders and obtain vital supplies.</p>

<p>As such, industries such as manufacturing, production, construction, wholesale, and more need to know what can cause a cash flow crunch.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>
	<br>
</h3>

<h3><strong>Late payments</strong></h3>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>The nail in the coffin for most businesses worried about cash flow shortages is, undoubtedly, late payments.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In invoice-dependent industries, one of the most common problems is actually receiving the money due for services delivered - with many only getting the value of their invoice 60, 90 or even 120, days beyond the 30-day payment deadline.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course, this can cause plenty of stress for businesses up and down the country, but can certainly create more issues for SMEs who need to deal with overhead expenses and pay staff without dipping into much-needed savings.</p>

<p>Usually, there are two reasons why late payments from customers occur, which are:</p>

<h4>
	<br>
</h4>

<h3>High-value but low-volume orders</h3>

<h3>
	<br>
</h3>

<p>In industries that often suffer the negative impact of <a href="https://timefinance.com/time-blog/late-invoice-payments-what-to-do">late payments and unpaid invoices</a>, many orders are fulfilled as low volume, but high-value. This operation can often lead to huge amounts of capital being left outstanding at any point - meaning that a significant chunk of missing money can easily cause business cash flow problems.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even more notably, just one late invoice represents a huge amount of money, which can become critical for smaller independents with ongoing expenses to deal with.</p>

<h4>
	<br>
</h4>

<h3>The payment chain is long</h3>

<h3>
	<br>
</h3>

<p>Another problem that involves industries that frequently experience delayed payments is where a long payment chain occurs.</p>

<p>When a business is at the end of a payment chain, it can be difficult for them to gain access to funds owed. This can take a long period of time, which increases the likelihood of contract disputes, which can lengthen the time it takes to settle finances.</p>

<h3>
	<br>
</h3>

<h3><strong>What does ineffective cash flow management do to a business?</strong></h3>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>Whether there's worry about overhead costs or maintaining poor cash flow simply prevents a business from being able to invest in its growth plans and achieve its goals - or can cause a lot of damage rather quickly.</p>

<p>It is impossible to overstate the significance of cash flow. It's the lifeblood of any business, helping to pay overhead costs, invest in operations, deal with suppliers, and more.</p>

<p>Delays in payments, or even partial payments, can eat into savings and cause insufficient cash reserves, increasing the cash burn rate and knocking the flow of capital out of balance.</p>

<p><strong>So what can be done?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>A financial product,&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/vision-and-values" href="https://timefinance.com/vision-and-values">such as invoice finance, can be an excellent solution for businesses facing cash flow problems.</a></p>

<p>At Time Finance, we offer bespoke invoice finance solutions to suit any business' needs now, and in the future.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>
	<br>
</h2>

<h2><strong>Invoice Finance: Could it be the cash flow solution you need?</strong></h2>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>Businesses have the power to release cash from unpaid invoices quickly with an invoice finance solution.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lenders, such as Time Finance, release up to 90% of the value of outstanding invoices within just 24 hours of it being raised - unlocking capital tied up in payment chains and sales ledgers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Depending on the situation and the level of control businesses require for collecting unpaid invoices, we offer different types of invoice financing, including factoring (mainly invoice factoring and <a href="https://timefinance.com/time-blog/debt-factoring">debt factoring</a>) and invoice discounting.</p>

<p>At Time Finance,&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/vision-and-values" href="https://timefinance.com/vision-and-values">our dedicated, relationship-driven approach means that we really take the time to understand a business and can tailor a facility to suit their exact needs.</a></p>

		<published><![CDATA[2023-03-07 16:22:40]]></published>
		<updated><![CDATA[2023-03-07 16:22:40]]></updated>
		<content><![CDATA[<p align="center" style="text-align: left;">At <a href="https://timefinance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time Finance</a>, we are proud to have built a workplace where women succeed and thrive. With 40% representation on our Operating Board and over 50% in the business as a whole, the knowledge and experience of our innovative, strategic and forward-thinking female leaders helps drive the success of our organisation and makes Time Finance the business it is today.</p>

<p align="center" style="text-align: left;">To mark International Women’s Day this year, we sat down with a number of remarkable women across the Time Finance business to hear their journey into the finance industry, how they embrace equity in their day-to-day work and use their positions for positive change.</p>

<p><img src="/storage/app/media/Team%20Members/Helen%20Wheeler_resized.jpg" style="width: 300px;" class="fr-fic fr-dib fr-fil"></p>

<p><strong>Helen Wheeler, Head of Operations in Invoice Finance</strong></p>

<p>“In my early career, going back 30 years now, the finance industry was a very different place - and very much male dominated. There were very few female role models that I could look up to. There was however, one Director in my first job who was very ahead of her time and would always encourage me to step outside my comfort zone. The more I did this, the more confident I became and I’ve worked very hard to climb the ladder using the values she instilled in me - putting in the hours to get where I need to be.</p>

<p>“Women like her, in a boardroom full of men, have paved the way for young women getting into finance today. For anybody coming into our industry: no matter their gender, there is always a place for you at Time Finance and the wider industry, as long as you’re willing to put the work in!”</p>

<p><img src="/storage/app/media/Team%20Members/tanya-raynes-x1000-2.jpg" style="width: 300px;" class="fr-fic fr-dib fr-fil"></p>

<p><strong>Tanya Raynes, Non-Executive Chair</strong></p>

<p>“I’m a firm believer that businesses benefit from a diverse perspective, and this is something we should continue to encourage and strive towards. Having worked in a variety of roles within a number of industries, I have seen first-hand the value and impact that women bring to the workplace and boardroom. It is common for women to find it difficult to promote themselves or to recognise their contribution when it comes to the important conversations. Women should continue to seize the opportunities they are presented with, using this to develop confidence and feel empowered as they pursue their career."</p>

<p><img src="/storage/app/media/Team%20Members/Sharon%20Bryden_resized.jpg" style="width: 300px;" class="fr-fic fr-dib fr-fil"></p>

<p><strong>Sharon Bryden, Director of Commercial Loans and ABL</strong></p>

<p>“At Time Finance there are lots of women in senior leadership positions and it's so encouraging to see, it really makes such a huge difference to the industry. It’s so important to have that diversity; women can offer just as much as men can. The key thing is that we put the perfect person forward for the job, it doesn’t matter who that is.</p>

<p>“Juggling a career with young children isn’t easy, but you can do it with the right support and keeping focused on what you want to achieve. Women have proven time and time again that they can excel when dealing with a lot of spinning plates.</p>

<p>“My best piece of advice for any young women looking to start out in their career is to never be afraid to push yourself out of the comfort zone, it’s all about believing in yourself and in your ability. Keep focused on that goal and nurture your relationships with other women in business, they’ll be a great help.”</p>

<p><strong>Laura Mollett, Head of Broker Sales</strong></p>

<p>“I always say that nobody works harder than a working mum! Juggling a career and your home-life is never an easy task, and one that requires meticulous organisation. Without that flexibility and understanding from employers, it can be quite tricky for mothers to return to their careers after maternity leave.</p>

<p>“At Time Finance, we have a hybrid working model which allows me to put in the hours leading my team of five, while also making sure I show up for my son. For anybody looking to get into the finance industry, I would always say take advantage of any opportunity to learn. Equip yourself with the knowledge and tools to be successful at your role and then just be true to your authentic self."</p>

<p><strong>Louise Ikonomides, Head of Business Improvements</strong></p>

<p>“When I first started my career there was very little available in terms of guidance, mentorship, and support in the industry. My experience early on taught me to be disciplined, to really believe in myself and what I was capable of, and to find the strength to keep pushing forward even when times felt challenging. It’s a mindset and confidence I would encourage any young woman to adopt when entering her career and trying to climb up the ranks. Recognising what drives you and makes you resilient really does help you to become the master of your own destiny.”</p>

<p><strong>Lorraine Neyland, Director of Risk</strong></p>

<p>“As we celebrate another International Women’s Day, I want to take a moment to celebrate how much our industry has transformed over the years. Having started my career in Risk over 35 years ago, in what was very much a man’s world, I’ve witnessed a lot of changes over the course of that time. Most notably, how rewarding it has been for women such as myself to go against the grain, climb up the ranks and have a voice at the table where important decisions are made. In 2023, there are more and more women entering and thriving in this field than ever before, and it’s a pleasure to see.”</p>

<p><img src="/storage/app/media/Team%20Members/Kate%20Brown%20resized.jpg" style="width: 300px;" class="fr-fic fr-dib fr-fil"></p>

<p><strong>Kate Brown, Head of Marketing</strong></p>

<p>“The financial services sector continues to make some really positive strides when it comes to female representation. In the short time I’ve worked in the industry, I’ve seen more and more women progressing into leadership roles and having a key voice at the table. It’s really encouraging and inspiring to see.</p>

<p>“I truly believe that having somebody notice something in you and believe in you can make all the difference. I owe many of my achievements to the support network I have around me, whether that’s through family, friends, peers or mentors. We need to instil confidence and provide the necessary tools for young women to embrace a career in finance. That’s why I’m so passionate about using my own experiences to elevate other women around me; I recognise how inspiring and encouraging it can be to have somebody in your corner cheering you on.”</p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<p align="center" style="text-align: left;">As the Chancellor prepares to deliver the 2023 Spring Statement, <strong><em>Ed Rimmer, Chief Executive Officer at Time Finance</em></strong>, shares his predictions for this year’s ‘mini budget’ and what businesses need to see from the Government to boost growth and productivity.</p>

<p>“It’s been a year since the former Chancellor made a series of promises to businesses to put in place measures and funding to boost innovation, skills training, productivity and growth. What this looked like was set to be announced just six months later, at which point a new Prime Minister and new Chancellor had an altogether different agenda. But just two months ago, Jeremy Hunt delivered a speech that got the conversation re-focussed on growth and productivity. He rejected declinism, and talked about the reasons for optimism, giving businesses hope that the Government has a plan for productivity, innovation and economic growth.</p>

<p>“Although this will effectively be a ‘mini budget’, there should be nothing small about it. Businesses have faced several years of economic instability, and more recently rising costs. Many have thrived against the odds and evolved to respond to these pressures, but in contrast, many haven’t. In 2022 we saw business insolvencies reach a 13-year high at 22,000, which is a shocking statistic. There is always a natural cycle of business insolvencies, but this drastic upward curve needs action. A two-pronged strategy is what’s needed from the Government - measures to support the survival of viable businesses, and a strategy to support growth.</p>

<p><strong>Balancing overheads with growth</strong></p>

<p>“There are predictions that energy prices will fall in 2023 - good news for everyone but particularly for businesses that will lose much of the Government’s support from next month. This will, however, happen at the same time as the planned rise in corporation tax from 19% to 25%. Though businesses have had time to plan for this increase, it will undoubtedly hit them hard just when they are looking for some respite from rising costs. This increase is estimated to generate an additional £18bn a year for the treasury, and what I would like to see is some tangible benefit being funnelled back to businesses from this extra revenue. New investments in training, investments in research and development and advances in the green economy to support sustainability. If businesses are paying higher taxes, they need to see this returned to them in the form of measures that will help them grow.”</p>

<p><strong>Boosting the UK workforce</strong></p>

<p>“Workforce shortages have been a major challenge for businesses over the past few years, and it is time they saw a plan of how this is going to be addressed. Competitive job markets have contributed to rising costs, which has in-turn fueled rises in inflation. There are estimates that there are 6.6 million people not currently in employment, and given the right means, support and investment, bringing the majority of these people into work would unlock a new stream of talent for UK businesses.</p>

<p>“In a recent poll we asked our business community if the employment market was in a good shape to withstand a recession and 56% said the job market is slowing down. So the challenge for the Government is two-fold - measures are needed to stimulate the job market while putting in place systems that support people into work. Reform for childcare provision is on the cards, but there are many more layers to this. Investment in skills is a huge opportunity here. It is one thing to put in place systems to help people back into work but it is another to equip them with the knowledge and skills for the industries that need them most. Real and targeted investment in training and development will be essential for businesses.”</p>

<p>“The Government is moving towards its target to halve inflation this year and it remains to be seen how this will be achieved. Ultimately, the focus must be on creating financial stability, which breeds confidence and optimism. Businesses that feel secure are businesses that are more likely to take risks, and as the Chancellor said in January, it is the risk takers who succeed, grow and prosper.”</p>]]></content>

		<title><![CDATA[The Spring Statement: Everything you need to know]]></title>
		<slug><![CDATA[the-spring-statement-everything-you-need-to-know]]></slug>

		<updated><![CDATA[2023-03-17 13:33:42]]></updated>
		<content><![CDATA[<p>There were a lot of headline grabbers in this year’s Spring Statement, but one of the biggest was the Office for Budget Responsibility’s (OBR) predictions that the UK will not enter a technical recession in 2023 - very encouraging news for businesses. There was a lot announced this time around, so here’s our handy guide to help you break down the main takeaways.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<ol start="1" type="1">
	<li><strong>Corporation Tax Rise</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>As expected, the Government pressed ahead with its rise to Corporation Tax, taking this from 19p to 25p. While businesses have had some time to prepare for this shift, it will undoubtedly still cause a ripple effect through their finances - particularly as there will be little support on energy prices in the next tax year.<em>&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<ol start="2" type="1">
	<li><strong>Childcare Support&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Arguably the largest talking point of the Government’s budget this time around was that of childcare support. The Chancellor’s ‘back-to-work budget’ brought £4 billion funding for early years childcare provision. The UK’s workforce pay some of the highest childcare fees globally and the changes announced promise to reduce early years childcare costs by 60%. Parents working a minimum of 16 hours a week will now receive 15 hours free childcare for children aged nine months to five years. The Government will introduce this in a staggered way with working parents of two-year-olds able to access 15 hours of funded care from April 2024, which will be extended to all children from nine months up from September 2024. From September 2025 every single working parent of under 5s will have access to 30 hours free childcare per week.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<ol start="3" type="1">
	<li><strong>Investment in Innovation</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>The Government has brought into play a £1.8 billion Research and Development (R&amp;D) credit package for small and medium sized businesses. This means they’re able to claim £27 for every £100 spent on research and development. This relief can be claimed if they dedicate 40% or more of their total expenditure in this area.</p>

<p>The Chancellor also announced an increase to the Annual Investment Allowance to £1 million; a replacement of the Super Deduction Tax. Essentially what this allows businesses to do is claim full capital expensing for business investments, giving businesses the confidence to make those all important investments in technology now, so that they can grow and prosper.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<ol start="4" type="1">
	<li><strong>Employment support</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Measures to tackle labour shortages were high on the Chancellor’s agenda, but failed to fully address the skills shortage. The introduction of ‘returnerships’ for the over 50’s is set to encourage retirees back into the workforce. An additional £400 million will be dedicated to increased support for musculoskeletal (MSK) and mental health care for workers, ensuring they are supported adequately to enable them to return to the workplace.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<ol start="5" type="1">
	<li><strong>Investment Zones</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>With the crash of Silicon Valley Bank, the Government expressed the need to build larger more diverse investment systems here in the UK and vowed to return on this promise in his next budget. In the meantime, the Chancellor appeared to be putting in place a machine for growth, here in the UK, with the introduction of additional Investment Zones, or “potential Canary Wharfs”.</p>

<p>Various regions across the UK will be invited to pitch to become an Investment Zone and if successful will be eligible for £80 million in funding to boost the local economy. These English regions include: Greater Manchester, the East and West Midlands, West and South Yorkshire, the North East and Tees Valley as well as Liverpool City Region.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<ol start="6" type="1">
	<li><strong>Energy Price Guarantee Continuation&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Whilst wholesale energy costs for businesses have essentially been capped under the Energy Bill Relief scheme until now, this will draw to a close at the end of March 2023 and the Government’s new Energy Bill Discount Scheme will offer much less protection for businesses. Welcome news to many households was the Chancellor’s extension of the Energy Price Guarantee (EPG) which will keep the average household bill at £2,500 until the end of June. However, this does not support commercial buildings, already struggling to meet such high bills.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<ol start="7" type="1">
	<li><strong>Sustainable</strong> <strong>tax relief</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>In a bid to reduce business’ energy use by 15%, the Chancellor revealed a £60 million Climate Change Levy tax relief scheme on energy efficient measures for businesses. Under this Government drive, the Climate Change Agreement Scheme has been extended by two years and nuclear power will now also be classified as “environmentally sustainable” to boost investment in this area.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p><strong>So, what does this mean for UK businesses?</strong></p>

<p>Whilst Jeremy Hunt’s budget does acknowledge the widening gap in the UK’s workforce, in equal measures it failed to actually put wheels in motion to fix this skills shortage - a huge and recurring issue for a great number of businesses.</p>

<p>There was very little direct support in the Government’s budget for SMEs on the frontline. Now more than ever, the small and medium sized business community would welcome direct financial support to help manage their looming overheads, from paying staff on time to keeping up with energy payments.</p>

<p>For the Government’s rise in Corporation Tax to become fruitful for the economy, SMEs need these funds to be reinvested back and funnelled into initiatives that will truly support their growth, and enable them to take the risks in innovation that the Government so wishes.</p>

<p>The Chancellor labelled the UK the best place to do business; a sentiment echoed by many but congratulating ourselves can tempt complacency. The new measures introduced, need to be backed by the appropriate infrastructure in order for businesses to feel the knock on effect.</p>

<p>What is certain is that SMEs needed more direct and specific initiatives from this Spring budget, to curb the growing skills shortage and stabilise the landscape, providing room for innovation and growth. For those SMEs - not working within Investment Zones - the Chancellor’s budget fell short of tangible resources. For the many firms now seeking out alternative resolutions to support their day-to-day runnings and enable their growth plans, alternative finance solutions at Time Finance will be on hand to guide businesses through this ever-changing landscape.</p>]]></content>

		<published><![CDATA[2023-03-27 07:40:19]]></published>
		<updated><![CDATA[2023-03-27 07:40:19]]></updated>
		<content><![CDATA[<p>New data from Time Finance has revealed the worsening challenge of late payment debt as it finds SMEs are owed on average quarter of a million pounds in outstanding invoices.</p>

<p>In a recent survey, the alternative finance provider to UK SMEs, uncovered that one in three businesses are forced to wait between 60 and 120 days for invoices to be paid by their customers. It is a problem that continues to significantly hold businesses back from realising their investment plans, claims Time Finance.</p>

<p>The new survey has been commissioned by Time Finance’s <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance">Invoice Finance</a> team, which works on behalf of hundreds of businesses to recoup revenue from outstanding invoices, giving businesses access to working capital to support overheads and growth strategies.</p>

<p>Stressing the importance of supporting UK businesses, Time Finance is sharing its new data following news that business insolvencies reached a 13-year high in 2022 with 22,000 businesses forced to fold.</p>

<p><strong>Phil Chesham, Managing Director of Invoice Finance at Time Finance, commented:</strong> “Late payments from invoices have always been a barrier for businesses, but it is becoming much more of a challenge due to rising costs. Overheads mount up, belts become tighter and that creates real financial strain. If this issue is not nipped in the bud, it can be the difference between a business thriving or going under.</p>

<p>“The problem with late payment is how much it can limit success; a business can’t access the money it needs to pay its bills, or even its staff, but it also lacks headroom to invest in innovation or react quickly to opportunities. This then has a knock-on effect on a business’ supply chain, who, when also not paid, struggle to meet their own overheads or finance growth ambitions.</p>

<p>“£250,000 is a significant figure and for many businesses, is unlocked potential. That capital, if it’s in their bank account where it should be, can help a business pay its staff and its mounting bills, giving them the room to look beyond survival towards future growth whether that’s through new tech, developing skills or improving sustainability. It is absolutely vital that businesses are able to access this capital. Our job market and our economic growth rely on it.”</p>

<p>Time Finance offers Confidential and Disclosed Invoice Finance facilities ranging from £10,000 to £2.5million to UK SMEs, with the added flexibility that their funding lines can grow alongside a business. As well as Invoice Finance solutions, the alternative finance provider provides Asset Finance, Business Loan and Asset Based Lending solutions, and supports more than 10,000 business owners across the UK.</p>]]></content>

		<title><![CDATA[What is Debt Factoring & How Does it Work?]]></title>
		<slug><![CDATA[debt-factoring]]></slug>
		<published><![CDATA[2023-01-31 12:00:00]]></published>
		<updated><![CDATA[2023-01-31 12:00:00]]></updated>
		<content><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Debt Factoring,&nbsp;<a href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/disclosed-confidential-invoice-finance">which is also known as ‘Disclosed Invoice Finance’, can help businesses of all sizes unlock working capital tied up in unpaid invoices</a> - allowing them to pursue new and exciting avenues of growth.</p>

<p dir="ltr">With Time Finance, companies can release up to 90% of the value of these outstanding payments by using our debt factoring service to free up precious time and get that all important working capital into the business. Business owners can focus on what matters to them and their business, while our dedicated credit controllers handle the rest.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">So, what is debt factoring?</h2>

<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance">Debt Factoring is a type of funding solution which sits under the umbrella term ‘Invoice Finance’,</a> offering an immediate boost into the business in the form of a cash injection. This extra working capital can be released quickly - sometimes as quickly as within 24 of the invoice being raised - giving businesses peace of mind and a much-improved cash flow. &nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">However, the main difference between disclosed invoice factoring and other types of invoice finance is that it comes with an additional credit control service.</p>

<p dir="ltr">This works by contacting the customers of our clients on their behalf, with our credit control team assisting with the &nbsp;collection of unpaid invoices for services or products rendered to those customers.</p>

<p dir="ltr">By choosing a debt factoring facility with us, businesses are able to manage their sales ledger through a dedicated credit support team. This gives them the time to focus on more pressing matters like growing their offering and exploring new avenues, while our team recoups outstanding payments - while maintaining those crucial working relationships.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">How does debt factoring work?</h2>

<p dir="ltr">We know that overdue payments can cause stress and strain on many businesses, impacting their cash flow position and overall access to capital.</p>

<p dir="ltr">With an invoice finance solution, supplemented by a debt factoring facility, instead of waiting for 30, 60, or sometimes 90 days to get paid - companies can&nbsp;access up to 90% of the value of unpaid invoices&nbsp;within just 24 hours.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">At Time Finance, most types of invoice factoring and financing follow the same pattern.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">A business, having provided goods or a service to their customer base, will send an invoice as usual.</p>

<p dir="ltr">It's important to note that businesses must deal directly with other businesses and supply invoices for us to be able to assist with this kind of finance.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Other financial products that we offer may be more appropriate if they provide goods to the general public.&nbsp;<a href="https://timefinance.com/contact">A member of our friendly team will be able to help create a tailored solution for your clients - just get in touch!</a></p>

<p dir="ltr">Once this invoice has been sent, businesses simply need to raise it with us and we'll pay up to 90% of the value within a day of it being issued.</p>

<p dir="ltr">This capital can be used for a variety of helpful fixes throughout the business,&nbsp;<a href="https://timefinance.com/clients/category/invoice-finance">which makes this financial solution attractive for SMEs from a variety of backgrounds and sectors.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p dir="ltr">These uses include:</p>

<ul>
	<li aria-level="1" dir="ltr">

		<p dir="ltr">Easing pressure from overheads</p>
	</li>
	<li aria-level="1" dir="ltr">

		<p dir="ltr">Smoothing incoming costs</p>
	</li>
	<li aria-level="1" dir="ltr">

		<p dir="ltr">Navigate investments in other aspects of the business such as equipment or new systems</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p dir="ltr">With a debt factoring service,&nbsp;<a href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/outsourced-credit-control">we can take over a business’s credit control facility and begin to recover the unpaid debts owed by their customer base.</a></p>

<p dir="ltr">One of the most well-liked features of a factoring arrangement is that it frees up time and money that would otherwise be spent on their internal operations, as our team will manage the debt assignment.</p>

<p dir="ltr">When we have collected this sum, we will pay the balance of the invoice with our factoring service fee deducted.</p>

<p dir="ltr">We know that managing invoices and invoice payments directly with customers is time-consuming and stressful for many businesses. Factoring offers a credit control service that eliminates these worries.</p>

<p dir="ltr">However, it's important to note that the customers of the clients we support will be aware that they have &nbsp;used a financial solution to help them recoup outstanding invoices.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Debt factoring means that we will manage credit control on a business’s behalf, with our teams dealing directly with the customer base to collect owed monies.</p>

<p dir="ltr">But we also offer a confidential service so that a business’s customer base will remain unaware of our involvement, if they prefer to keep their financial arrangements private.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://timefinance.com/contact">If you would like to discuss which solution you think your business would be best suited to, please speak with a member of our team.</a></p>

<h2 dir="ltr">If you’re a financial intermediary, how do you know if debt factoring is right for your client's business?</h2>

<p dir="ltr">Debt factoring is a helpful financial product and funding choice for companies looking for a cash injection to fuel their expansion and manage the everyday expenditure of running a business while gaining assistance in collecting the value of invoices from customers.</p>

<p dir="ltr">By using this sort of financing, SMEs can release up to 90% of the value of unpaid invoices and reinvest the proceeds into their operations, giving them the opportunity to explore new opportunities unhindered by unpaid bills.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Debt Factoring, also known as ’Disclosed Invoice Finance’, gives enterprises the ability to access funds from pending customer payments.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">One of the main advantages of invoice factoring is that it can offer clients a cash injection, without them worrying about chasing down money to cover mounting expenses.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">It's especially useful as a financial solution in sectors where invoices are frequently paid past due, leaving businesses to wait 30, 60, 90 or even 120 days for the money to show up. It can also alleviate the anxiety of business owners who have recurring expenses, allowing them to worry-free meet their current financial obligations while pursuing new projects.</p>

<p dir="ltr">As a result, invoice financing is a great approach to guarantee a positive cash flow and release important working capital.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">Want to learn more about how you can boost your client’s cash flow?</h2>

<p dir="ltr">At Time Finance, we collaborate with intermediaries and business owners alike to help source the finest financial solution for their needs.</p>

<p dir="ltr">So if you're an intermediary wishing to connect your client with a relationship-driven and supportive funder, we'll be more than happy to help.</p>

<p dir="ltr">In addition to helping your client close the cash flow gap, we can provide flexible funding lines that will expand with their future growth plans.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://timefinance.com/business-development-team">With years of experience tailoring deals for an impressive roster of clients,</a> our Invoice Finance team makes it easy for them to get the finance they need to succeed.</p>

<p dir="ltr">We know that it's important for you to introduce your clients to reputable and trustworthy lenders.</p>

		<content><![CDATA[<p>Market resilience and optimism continue to boost confidence amongst brokers and fuel plans for growth, finds <a href="http://www.timefinance.com">Time Finance</a>.</p>

<p>In a recent industry roundtable, the alternative finance provider invited a panel of leading Asset Finance brokers from across the country to discuss market predictions for 2023 and plans to assist recovery and growth of the UK SME market. The conversation covered the vital role of technology and data, the specific training required to support the next generation of brokers and confidence for the year ahead.</p>

<p>The overriding outcome uncovered universal optimism from brokers as they told Time Finance of plans to expand their workforce and increase their headcount to keep up with the growing demand for finance from businesses. Upskilling existing employees through bespoke training packages and funder-led broker academies was deemed to be a key priority for the year ahead.</p>

<p>Across the board, investment plans were fuelled by a confidence in the recovery and strength of small-medium business community, who make up 99% of the UK economy. This included bringing in new systems, processes, and technology to quicken funding decisions and adopting a data-led strategy to uncover emerging trends and identify opportunities to offer additional support for clients.</p>

<p><strong>Steve Nichols, Director Asset Finance at Time Finance, said:</strong> “We’re encouraged by the resilience and adaptability of the broker market as they set wheels in motion to invest, grow and bolster their support for SMEs in 2023.</p>

<p>“In the wake of rising costs, supply chain disruption and many other cashflow challenges hampering businesses right now, our roundtable comes at a crucial time and shines a light on the importance of helping businesses feel confident about their future. It’s fantastic to see such a remarkable ability from our brokers to pivot, adapt and innovate, which will only help to poise brokers and our collective clients for success in 2023.”</p>

<p>Amongst the attendees were Tom Roberts from Moorgate Finance, Carl Johnson from Anglo Scottish, George Parker from Halo Finance, Jack Smith from Love Finance, Ryan Williams from Victor Finance, Tom Perkins from Charles &amp; Dean and Rob Dermody from PMD Business Finance.</p>

<p><strong>Steve added:</strong> “We look forward to hosting many more roundtables and continuing to bring together our valued broker network to discuss the future of finance for SMEs and how best we can support their ever changing needs. And, as we continue to invest in our own offering and increase our support for SMEs, we too remain optimistic about the opportunities that lie ahead.”</p>

<p>Time Finance supports more than 10,000 UK businesses every year with flexible and supportive funding solutions. The alternative finance provider specialises in the provision of funding solutions to UK businesses seeking to access the finance they need to realise their growth plans, with a diverse portfolio that includes <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/asset-finance">Asset Finance</a>, <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance">Invoice Finance</a>, <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/loans">Business Loans</a>, and its recently established <a href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/asset-based-lending">Asset Based Lending</a> solution.</p>]]></content>

		<slug><![CDATA[how-do-business-loans-work]]></slug>
		<published><![CDATA[2023-04-05 11:02:34]]></published>
		<updated><![CDATA[2023-04-05 11:02:34]]></updated>
		<content><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to keeping those all-important business operations moving,&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/loans" href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/loans">there are a number of finance options that can help.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>From overdrafts to lines of credit, pitching investments and alternative funding streams like&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/" href="https://timefinance.com/">asset finance, invoice finance and asset-based lending</a> - traditional loans are still one of the most popular choices.</p>

<p>But as any intermediary knows, getting access to funding solutions tailored to their client’s specific needs can be quite the task. Especially as a business develops over time, the needs of operations can quickly change - meaning that they require access to a business finance solution that can keep up with their own pace of change.</p>

<p>That’s where a business loan can come in handy. But how do business loans work? And which one is best for your SME client?&nbsp;</p>

<p>In this blog,&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/our-team" href="https://timefinance.com/our-team">the Time Finance team will be able to give you everything you need to know on business loans, from how to check if your client is eligible, to seeing which one will suit their needs the most.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>We'll also talk about some of the main benefits for SMEs, as well as signposting handy tips and financial solutions that we have on hand that can help.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So what are you waiting for? Let's get started.</p>

<h2>
	<br>
</h2>

<h2><strong>What is a business loan?</strong></h2>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>Whether your client has only been running a business for a few years or is an instantly recognisable part of their industry, there will likely come a time when they’ll need to consider - or at least think about - obtaining extra funding.</p>

<p>However, a client might not have that amount of working capital available to invest in new equipment, or they may prefer to sustain their cash flow. But instead of missing out on exciting new opportunities because the cash isn’t available at that moment, a business loan can help bridge the gap.</p>

<p><a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/business-loans" href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/business-loans">Although there are many different types of business loans available,</a> each with their own advantages, uses and criteria, their usual scope is their ability to allow SMEs to borrow a set amount of capital. This is then paid off in set instalments, often on a monthly basis, for a period of time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Depending on whether they’ve chosen a short-term loan or require a facility for a longer period, repayment terms can last between a year to up to five in some cases.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p><strong>When it comes to traditional business loans, they usually fall under the following category:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p><strong>Secured loans:&nbsp;</strong><a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/secured-business-loans" href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/secured-business-loans">These allow you to use an asset as collateral to obtain money for your company,&nbsp;</a>which gives you larger amounts of capital with lower interest rates.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At Time Finance, we have helped hundreds of companies up and down the country through the use of our Buiness Loan offering.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, there are other types of loans that can be used to help businesses thrive.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We’ll explain these in a bit more detail in the next section.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p><strong>A closer look at different funding options</strong></p>

<p>No two businesses are the same. When considering a loan, it’s important to look at the different types of working finance available, their specific benefits and whether they would fit into your client’s plans for now and in the future.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At Time Finance, we offer many different products and services that can help SMEs obtain both short and long-term goals - whether they deal with B2B or B2C custom.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As such, other types of funding solutions include:</p>

<h3>
	<br>
</h3>

<h3><strong>Asset-based lending</strong></h3>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>As the name suggests, <a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/asset-finance" href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/asset-finance">an asset-based loan is a type of secured loan that is backed by a business asset for collateral.</a> This means businesses could obtain more capital with this kind of loan than alternative funding solutions, using a number of assets already available in order to secure the facility.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This includes:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Machinery</li>
	<li>Property</li>
	<li>Stock</li>
	<li>Invoices</li>
	<li>Land</li>
</ul>

<p>With a range of flexible repayment options, Asset Based Lending protects cashflow, giving them the freedom to grow their business at their own pace.</p>

<h3>
	<br>
</h3>

<h3><strong>Invoice finance</strong></h3>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>If your client operates strictly B2B, then invoice finance might be a useful solution - especially when it comes to maintaining vital cash flow and protecting their reserves.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, it does work slightly differently than a normal cash loan.</p>

<p>Rather than lending a cash lump sum,<a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance" href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance">&nbsp;Invoice Finance enables SMEs to access up to 90% of the value of outstanding customer invoices before they are due - often dispensing funding within 24 hours of the original invoice being raised.</a></p>

<p>At Time Finance, we not only provide the funding but also offer an optional credit control service. This is where we manage a tailored collections process on your client’s behalf, relieving pressure on existing operations.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Working capital loans</strong></h3>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>Often used to assist in covering the day-to-day operating expenses of a firm, a working capital loan is an extra resource used to fund whatever SMEs might need to keep things ticking over.</p>

<p>They can help invest and boost growth plans without using up existing business savings, whether it's to stabilise a cash flow problem or operational costs, invest in extra equipment, or simply enjoy the flexibility of a capital solution.</p>

<p>At Time Finance, <a href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/working-capital-loans">we offer working capital loans</a> in the form of a secured loan.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This means that a business can access anywhere between £50k to £500k of incredibly useful capital on both a short and long term basis.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This particular facility is secured against collateral - usually property - with a straightforward monthly repayment structure for easy-to-follow budgeting.</p>

<h2><strong>Qualifying your client for a business loan with Time Finance</strong></h2>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>When it comes to business loan eligibility, it can be tricky to know exactly where to start.</p>

<p>Business loan requirements can vary depending on the type of facility your client is looking to use: as there are different needs for invoice finance compared to a secured loan, for example.</p>

<p>As the name suggests, for invoice finance, we only accept applications on behalf of B2B Businesses who supply invoices on credit terms for the goods and services they provide.</p>

<p>When deciding which facility would be most suitable for a business, it is important to consider how long it will take to pay off the loan,<a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/time-blog/what-funding-stream-is-right-for-your-business" href="https://timefinance.com/time-blog/what-funding-stream-is-right-for-your-business">&nbsp;how long you’ll need the capital for and whether you have the means to offer up suitable collateral.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>For secured loans, assets such as machinery, property or equipment, may be required in order to obtain funding.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p><strong>Other factors that are taken into account when recommending loans include:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Existing financial performance</li>
	<li>Future plans and ongoing growth&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Credit history&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>When it comes to these products, Time Finance will only consider eligible applicants who have been operating for two years or more and are UK-based.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, we do take a holistic approach to every case, so if your client is concerned about their financial performance or history -&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/contact" href="https://timefinance.com/contact">it’s still worth giving us a call.</a></p>

<h2>
	<br>

<h2><strong>The benefits of using a business loan</strong></h2>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>Businesses might consider a loan for a variety of reasons.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Whether it’s the right time to think about expansion or consider a new ‘arm’ of services - but another piece of equipment is needed to make it happen - a funding facility can make big things happen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	<br>However, borrowing tends to fall into the following categories:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Accelerate growth now and in the future</li>
	<li>Capitalise on an immediate return</li>
	<li>Manage day-to-day cashflow&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Keep up with business expenses</li>
</ul>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h4>Borrowing to accelerate growth</h4>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p><a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/clients/category/loans" href="https://timefinance.com/clients/category/loans">SMEs often use products like a business loan to help hire additional staff, acquire larger facilities, and extend operations into new areas.&nbsp;</a>These can help accelerate growth that might have otherwise fallen to the wayside, especially if extra funds are not available at the most opportune time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This investment in the short-term can help strengthen the overall capability of the business, helping you delve into new markets, test new product lines and services or simply onboard some more helping hands ahead of - or during - periods of huge growth.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, when assessing your business's growth potential, take into account competition within the sector and the necessary steps to reach success at this stage - as well as your ability to place suitable collateral up to facilitate the loan.</p>

<h4>
	<br>
</h4>

<h4>Borrowing for an immediate return</h4>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>Whether you have a specific area you’d like to invest in or would like to allocate funds to an opportunity with significant potential, a business loan can help you secure those profits.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As with any loan facility, it’s important to calculate how much you require and the overall cost against your expected profit margins. It is also crucial to be realistic regarding the time required to achieve the desired level of growth when considering making an investment.</p>

<p>At Time Finance, a dedicated Business Development Manager will be able to make recommendations for clients based on your application and plans for growth. Then we’ll match them with the right product, tailored to their exact requirements.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h4>Manage day-to-day cashflow and business expenses</h4>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>A business' cash flow is essential to keeping things moving. Basically, it means making sure the cash coming into the business is greater than the outgoing expenditures. It’s a problem that can impact SMEs and established companies, with <a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/time-blog/the-importance-of-cashflow" href="https://timefinance.com/time-blog/the-importance-of-cashflow">90 percent of SMEs set to fail because of poor cash flow management</a> due to late payments to suppliers, HMRC, and even employees.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Taking out a business loan to help bridge the gap and manage overheads can give SMEs some much-needed peace of mind, while preserving vital savings that should be used for a rainy day. Invoice Finance is a great option for strengthening cashflow, helping businesses focus on more important aspects of growing their operations while we handle the rest.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Plus, having access to funds as soon as an order is finanalised - rather than waiting sometimes three months or more for payment - can help your clients budget effectively. That’s all without sacrificing your business opportunities or day-to-day operations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A Secured Loan can also place much-needed capital towards an exciting new piece of equipment or an expense, while preserving internal funds. Our loan solutions can support a wide range of situations and businesses, with facilities available between £50k to £500k, to help make those crucial plans come to life.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With flexible terms ranging up to five years, we can help structure a loan to suit your client’s unique needs and goals, making those dreams a reality.&nbsp;</p>

		<content><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to keeping those all-important business operations moving,&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/loans" href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/loans">there are a number of finance options that can help.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>From overdrafts to lines of credit, pitching investments and alternative funding streams like&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/" href="https://timefinance.com/">asset finance, invoice finance and asset-based lending</a> - traditional loans are still one of the most popular choices.</p>

<p>But as any intermediary knows, getting access to funding solutions tailored to their client’s specific needs can be quite the task. Especially as a business develops over time, the needs of operations can quickly change - meaning that they require access to a business finance solution that can keep up with their own pace of change.</p>

<p>That’s where a business loan can come in handy. But how do business loans work? And which one is best for your SME client?&nbsp;</p>

<p>In this blog,&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/our-team" href="https://timefinance.com/our-team">the Time Finance team will be able to give you everything you need to know on business loans, from how to check if your client is eligible, to seeing which one will suit their needs the most.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>We'll also talk about some of the main benefits for SMEs, as well as signposting handy tips and financial solutions that we have on hand that can help.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So what are you waiting for? Let's get started.</p>

<h2>
	<br>
</h2>

<h2><strong>What is a business loan?</strong></h2>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>Whether your client has only been running a business for a few years or is an instantly recognisable part of their industry, there will likely come a time when they’ll need to consider - or at least think about - obtaining extra funding.</p>

<p>However, a client might not have that amount of working capital available to invest in new equipment, or they may prefer to sustain their cash flow. But instead of missing out on exciting new opportunities because the cash isn’t available at that moment, a business loan can help bridge the gap.</p>

<p><a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/business-loans" href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/business-loans">Although there are many different types of business loans available,</a> each with their own advantages, uses and criteria, their usual scope is their ability to allow SMEs to borrow a set amount of capital. This is then paid off in set instalments, often on a monthly basis, for a period of time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Depending on whether they’ve chosen a short-term loan or require a facility for a longer period, repayment terms can last between a year to up to five in some cases.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p><strong>When it comes to traditional business loans, they usually fall under the following category:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p><strong>Secured loans:&nbsp;</strong><a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/secured-business-loans" href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/secured-business-loans">These allow you to use an asset as collateral to obtain money for your company,&nbsp;</a>which gives you larger amounts of capital with lower interest rates.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At Time Finance, we have helped hundreds of companies up and down the country through the use of our Buiness Loan offering.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, there are other types of loans that can be used to help businesses thrive.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We’ll explain these in a bit more detail in the next section.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p><strong>A closer look at different funding options</strong></p>

<p>No two businesses are the same. When considering a loan, it’s important to look at the different types of working finance available, their specific benefits and whether they would fit into your client’s plans for now and in the future.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At Time Finance, we offer many different products and services that can help SMEs obtain both short and long-term goals - whether they deal with B2B or B2C custom.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As such, other types of funding solutions include:</p>

<h3>
	<br>
</h3>

<h3><strong>Asset-based lending</strong></h3>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>As the name suggests, <a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/asset-finance" href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/asset-finance">an asset-based loan is a type of secured loan that is backed by a business asset for collateral.</a> This means businesses could obtain more capital with this kind of loan than alternative funding solutions, using a number of assets already available in order to secure the facility.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This includes:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Machinery</li>
	<li>Property</li>
	<li>Stock</li>
	<li>Invoices</li>
	<li>Land</li>
</ul>

<p>With a range of flexible repayment options, Asset Based Lending protects cashflow, giving them the freedom to grow their business at their own pace.</p>

<h3>
	<br>
</h3>

<h3><strong>Invoice finance</strong></h3>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>If your client operates strictly B2B, then invoice finance might be a useful solution - especially when it comes to maintaining vital cash flow and protecting their reserves.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, it does work slightly differently than a normal cash loan.</p>

<p>Rather than lending a cash lump sum,<a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance" href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance">&nbsp;Invoice Finance enables SMEs to access up to 90% of the value of outstanding customer invoices before they are due - often dispensing funding within 24 hours of the original invoice being raised.</a></p>

<p>At Time Finance, we not only provide the funding but also offer an optional credit control service. This is where we manage a tailored collections process on your client’s behalf, relieving pressure on existing operations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These options are commonly known as:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li><a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/invoice-factoring" href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/invoice-factoring"><strong>Invoice factoring (or disclosed invoice financing)</strong>:</a> This is where we manage the client’s sales and can use a dedicated credit controller to collect the money directly from your customers.
		<br>

	<li><a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/invoice-discounting" href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/invoice-discounting"><strong>Invoice discounting (or confidential invoice financing)</strong>:</a> We simply release a percentage of the funds before your client’s invoices are paid, and receive the value of their funding line plus pre-agreed fees once the invoice is paid.</li>
</ul>

<h3>

<h3><strong>Working capital loans</strong></h3>

		<content><![CDATA[<p>Fresh data from Time Finance has uncovered the true impact of late payments for SMEs with 75% of UK businesses worrying about cashflow as a direct result of overdue invoices from their customers.</p>

<p>In a recent survey into the worsening challenge of late payments, Time Finance found that chasing payments was damaging customer relationships for 17% of businesses, while 8% said the lack of essential working capital meant they were unable to afford key investments.</p>

<p>With the rising cost of doing business, 100% of SMEs now claim that more of their customers are paying late due to increased overheads across the board.</p>

<p><strong>Phil Chesham, Managing Director of Invoice Finance at Time Finance, commented:</strong> “Last year, business insolvency reached a 13 year high with 22,000 business forces to fold. We need to understand the challenges that caused so many businesses to go under so that we can provide better support and avoid preventable insolvency for viable businesses. Rising costs are definitely a factor here, but businesses’ challenges do not begin and end with high overheads.</p>

<p>“Our research found that SMEs are owed on average £250k in outstanding invoices, and it’s no surprise that this is causing repercussions. This challenge simply isn’t sustainable for businesses. Their revenue is their lifeline; it’s how they meet their overheads and realise their ambitions. Without cash in the bank, the bills aren’t paid and growth plans are put on hold and both of these are huge threats to any business.</p>

<p>“Understanding the scale of late payments is essential to the service we provide at Time Finance. Invoice finance is a longstanding solution for businesses looking to build in headroom and run their business with confidence. We’ve witnessed demand significantly grow as more businesses recognise the value of this service.”</p>

<p>Through Invoice Finance, Time Finance works on behalf of hundreds of businesses to recoup revenue from outstanding invoices, giving businesses access to working capital to support overheads and growth strategies.</p>

<p>Time Finance offers Confidential and Disclosed Invoice Finance facilities ranging from £10,000 to £2.5million to UK SMEs, with the added flexibility that their funding lines can grow alongside a business. As well as Invoice Finance solutions, the alternative finance provider provides Asset Finance, Business Loan and Asset Based Lending solutions, and supports more than 10,000 business owners across the UK.</p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<p>Norwich-based energy consultancy, <a href="https://indigoswan.co.uk/">Indigo Swan</a>, has secured a six figure invoice finance facility with <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance">Time Finance</a> to accelerate its investment in sustainability and its support for the UK’s decarbonisation journey.</p>

<p>The award-winning consultancy secured the finance package to support the completion of a management-buy-out by Manager Director, James Groves, and deliver its renewed strategy forward. The invoice finance facility will assist a range of new initiatives including introducing new technology, processes, and systems to streamline the energy procurement process and enable businesses to reduce their energy consumption and environmental impact.</p>

<p>James Groves, the driving force behind the firm’s sustainability strategy, has helped the business further diversify its offering through the provision of energy audits, EV charging, energy efficiency measures and renewable technologies.</p>

<p>With support from dedicated team members Aimee Konieczny (Commercial Director), Hayley Leech (Finance Director) and Andrew Kindleysides (Operations Director), upskilling and recruiting talent will be a key priority for the energy consultancy in helping it achieve its green ambitions in 2023.</p>

<p><strong>James of Indigo Swan commented:&nbsp;</strong>“At the heart of our business is doing the right thing – both for our clients and for the UK’s green economy. We want to give businesses the tools and know-how to embrace a greener future and support them on their decarbonisation journey. Our new ‘Swan Sustainability’ project is a great example of doing just that.</p>

<p>“We’re very proud of the work we already do, but we know that to build on our success, we need to innovate and evolve.”</p>

<p>Established in 2010, Indigo Swan provides advice and support to connect clients to the most suitable tariff and energy companies. It currently employs a team of 27 and services near 600 clients in the property, education, manufacturing, and engineering sectors.</p>

<p><strong>James, added:</strong> “As a small business it’s been challenging to secure the funding we need from traditional lending routes, and for us it felt important to partner with a funder that listens to, understands, and has confidence in our ambitions. From our first conversation with Time Finance, we knew they were the ideal funding partner to do just that.”</p>

<p>Time Finance supports more than 10,000 UK businesses every year with flexible and supportive funding solutions. The alternative finance provider specialises in the provision of funding solutions to UK businesses seeking to access the finance they need to realise their growth plans, with a diverse portfolio that includes <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/asset-finance">Asset Finance</a>, <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance">Invoice Finance</a>, <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/loans">Business Loans</a>, and its recently established <a href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/asset-based-lending">Asset Based Lending</a> solution.</p>

<p><strong>Rob Walters, Business Development Manager at Time Finance, added:&nbsp;</strong>“We are very proud to be working alongside James and the team at Indigo Swan as they continue to drive positive change within the energy industry. Our experience within this sector allowed us to swiftly get a good grasp of the business, how they operate, their funding requirements, and plans for growth.</p>

<p>“By building in essential headroom for growth we can ensure that Indigo Swan are able to move quickly to keep up the pace with ever-evolving technologies and processes, and in turn give them the confidence to make a real impact in the future of sustainability.”</p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<p>New data from Time Finance has shown the growing popularity of invoice finance amongst the B2B business community, with demand predicted to rise throughout the year as SMEs set out to stabilise their finances.</p>

<p>The new insight shows that invoice finance is ranked highest amongst alternative finance solutions, with 32% of financial intermediaries stating that <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance">invoice finance will be the most popular service</a> to support cashflow this year.</p>

<p>The data forms part of a large-scale review conducted by <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance">Time Finance</a> to understand the financial challenges facing businesses, enabling the firm to tailor solutions that better serve the needs of its customers.</p>

<p>As part of the review, Time Finance also shed light on the impact of late customer payments, finding that SMEs are owed an average of £250k in unpaid invoices and some are waiting between up to 120 days for payments to come through.</p>

<p><strong>Phil Chesham, Managing Director of Invoice Finance at Time Finance, commented:</strong> “We are seeing a real uplift in businesses that come to us for invoice finance, and this is definitely a trend we expect to see continue throughout 2023. At face value, this is an indicator of the cashflow challenges that businesses are experiencing, but looking at this more positively, we can take this as a sign that more <a href="https://timefinance.com/time-blog/invoice-finance-for-smes">businesses are discovering the real value of invoice finance</a>.</p>

<p>“Invoice Finance is a helpful tool to manage cashflow and when harnessed as a part of a long-term financial strategy, it can ensure that a business has an uninterrupted supply of working capital in the bank. As a result, invoice finance enables businesses to inject their own money into their investment plans, whether that’s recruitment, skills development, equipment or marketing.”</p>

<p>For Norwich-based energy consultancy, Indigo Swan, a six figure invoice finance facility with Time Finance has enabled the acceleration of investment in sustainability and its support for the UK’s decarbonisation journey.</p>

<p><strong>James Groves, Managing Director of Indigo Swan, commented: “</strong>As a small business it’s been challenging to secure the funding we need from traditional lending routes, and for us it felt important to partner with a funder that listens to, understands, and has confidence in our ambitions.”</p>

		<title><![CDATA[Stress Awareness Month: Helping businesses to overcome financial headaches]]></title>
		<slug><![CDATA[stress-awareness-month-helping-businesses-to-overcome-financial-headaches]]></slug>
		<published><![CDATA[2023-04-28 07:50:30]]></published>
		<updated><![CDATA[2023-04-28 07:50:30]]></updated>
		<content><![CDATA[<p align="center" style="text-align: left;">Setting up and running your own business can be an incredibly rewarding and fulfilling experience. If you’re a business owner, you’ll know just how satisfying it can be having the freedom to make executive decisions that affect the future of not only your career and company, but also your personal life. It’s a privilege not everyone has the opportunity of achieving. The sense of pride that comes with this level of success can be second to none, so why are so many SME owners struggling to relish in the responsibility?</p>

<p>Well, according to the <a href="https://www.bacp.co.uk/news/news-from-bacp/2021/4-november-worrying-data-about-business-owners-struggles-with-mental-health-revealed/#:~:text=The%20biggest%20business%20setbacks%20for,running%20their%20business%20every%20day.">British Association for Counsellors and Psychotherapists</a>, 79% of business owners find running a business stressful. And for almost one in five, this stress causes daily thoughts of wanting to simply quit.</p>

<p>That’s why this Stress Awareness Month we want to spotlight the challenges businesses face, really understand their main sources of stress and highlight our commitment to supporting businesses through those financial headaches.</p>

<p><strong>What are the main sources of stress for businesses right now?</strong></p>

<p>Before having a faltering economy to grapple with, businesses have enough hurdles to jump over - from keeping employees and customers happy, to winning new business, balancing the books, remaining cashflow positive and staying competitive. Adding to these everyday issues, businesses now have a running skills shortage and soaring overheads thrown into the mix.</p>

<p>Our own research found that nearly half of SMEs said the biggest pressure keeping them up at night is rising costs. Perhaps more worryingly, 60% of business owners told us they are not comfortable talking about finances. It’s an issue we know needs to change as businesses can only find help if they seek it out.</p>

<p>We also know that over 80% of businesses believe stress is holding them back from taking risks and this only creates more caution. When it comes to business confidence, rising costs appear to only add to their worries. Without the finances behind them to take on new ventures, many firms appear to remain in a state of stagnation and survival, rather than taking their business to new heights.</p>

<p><strong>What’s the knock on effect?</strong></p>

<p>The impact that stress can have on a business’ success and its growth is quite alarming. Without the headroom and confidence to make those all-important decisions, some businesses may be left behind without the capacity to really set themselves up for the future; whether that’s to launch new product lines, switch to more sustainable supply chains or invest in new staff, expertise or employee training.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://mentalhealth-uk.org/blog/four-in-five-small-business-owners-tell-us-theyre-experiencing-poor-mental-health/">Mental Health UK</a>, four in five SME owners clai they are experiencing poor mental health. So, it’s important that we understand the factors causing stress within business and empower business owners not only to talk more about finances, but to utilise alternative solutions to help relieve financial stress. It’s also important that business owners take the time to recognise the causes of their struggles and find the right stress management tools. There are a number of great guides for <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/siimonreynolds/2013/03/25/6-ways-to-reduce-business-stress/?sh=684fa5be6f99">stress management</a><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/siimonreynolds/2013/03/25/6-ways-to-reduce-business-stress/?sh=684fa5be6f99">&nbsp;o</a>ut there.</p>

<p><strong>Combatting those financial headaches</strong></p>

<p>When troubles are taking hold of a business, we know that a personal and supportive approach to finance is invaluable. Time Finance prides itself on offering a tailored and considered approach to finance. We take the time to truly understand a business, all of its intricacies, the pitfalls and successes within it, before suggesting the right solution for growth. We believe it’s this compassion and understanding that makes our customers feel truly supported.</p>

<p>At a time when stress is holding businesses back, alternative finance could be the answer to easing financial pressures, cashflow issues or late payments from suppliers. For businesses needing the extra legroom to take risks and grasp hold of new opportunities, a cash injection can be invaluable, and allows businesses to take a leap of faith and find the freedom for growth.</p>]]></content>

<p>But for now, let's touch on the basics.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h3><strong>Invoice Finance&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p><a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance" href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance">A company can use invoice finance to get cash flowing into their business&nbsp;</a>- without having to rely on customer payments - to keep things running smoothly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Essentially, businesses borrow against the value of their unpaid invoices&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/asset-based-lending" href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/asset-based-lending">as a specific kind of asset-based lending.</a></p>

<p>Funding solutions such as invoice finance (which can also be known as factoring or invoice discounting) work on a very simple concept. In a nutshell, invoice finance bridges the gap between businesses and their customers by allowing them to access the value of their unpaid invoices rather than waiting 30, 60, or sometimes 90 days to receive payment.</p>

<p>Invoices can be paid within 24 hours of being raised with a provider such as Time Finance, helping to reduce overhead pressure by keeping cash flowing continuously.</p>

<p>Getting paid faster for finished work and not being held back by slow customer payments is much easier with invoice financing, giving businesses the power to pursue new orders without worrying about stagnating cash flow.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h3><strong>The benefits of Invoice Finance</strong></h3>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>With the help of invoice finance, companies are able to access an immediate cash injection - giving them the freedom to make sure that suppliers, employees and internal operations are running smoothly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This also gives businesses more breathing room to pursue other avenues of growth, such as the<a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/press-releases/investment-is-top-of-the-agenda-for-uk-businesses" href="https://timefinance.com/press-releases/investment-is-top-of-the-agenda-for-uk-businesses">&nbsp;investment in new equipment or machinery, personnel or even product lines without dipping into existing savings.</a></p>

<p>With Time Finance, firms can access up to 90% of the value of their unpaid invoices in just 24 hours.</p>

<p>

<h3><strong>Asset Finance&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p><a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/asset-finance" href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/asset-finance">Asset Finance is a funding solution that's commonly used by business owners to affordably introduce new equipment, technology, furniture, and software</a> into their day-to-day operations.</p>

<p>It’s a finance option that can be used to source all kinds of assets, whether that's brand-new or second-hand equipment, Asset Finance can support all kinds of investments with much-needed flexibility.</p>

<p>Asset Finance options offer business owners the ability to spread the cost of buying a brand-new piece of equipment into much more manageable, monthly payments.</p>

<p>So instead of paying a one-off lump sum of money - which can be cost-ineffective, especially when it puts a strain on cash flow and a dent in savings - businesses can affordably secure what they need.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At Time Finance, we offer two sub-categories of Asset Finance, which are:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li><a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/finance-lease" href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/finance-lease">Finance Lease&nbsp;</a></li>
	<li><a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/hire-purchase" href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/hire-purchase">Hire Purchase</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Depending on which is chosen, your client has the option to gain full ownership of the asset at the end of the agreement, or can simply return it to us or upgrade it for a newer model.</p>

<p>We can be flexible to support whatever your client needs.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h3><strong>The benefits of Asset Finance</strong></h3>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>For millions of companies trying to expand and scale their operations, as well as those wanting to add new assets without badly impacting their cash flow, asset finance can be a great tool.</p>

<p><a href="https://timefinance.com/time-blog/how-does-asset-finance-work">Asset finance offers a sustainable approach to financing</a> while allowing access to extra working capital in the business, that's ready to be utilised when it's needed most.</p>

<p>Areas in which Asset Finance can help SMEs in their growth journey include sourcing the equipment they need to get their businesses off the ground or expand into new markets, assisting with day-to-day operations and granting better access to new technology and tools.</p>

<p>To find out more, <a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/intermediaries" href="https://timefinance.com/intermediaries">get in touch with our Broker Managers.</a> They'd be more than happy to help.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h3><strong>Business Loans</strong></h3>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>Business loans come in a variety of forms, but at Time Finance we specialise in Secured Loans - offering a larger cash injection and more long-term solution for your clients.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Choosing secured loans provides companies with larger sums of money in exchange for "high-value assets," which are utilised as security or collateral.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In essence, these assets serve as a personal assurance between the business owner and the lender to protect the loan. Usually, the loan is secured by one or more of these items, such as equipment or residential property.</p>

<p>This is because lenders, such as Time Finance, feel more confident about the security of the business when businesses put down larger assets - enabling them to unlock greater facilities as needed.</p>

<p>At Time Finance, we usually consider a number of factors before confirming a facility, such as evaluating the company's credit score and assets. Once this is agreed, cash will be transferred.</p>

<p><a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/secured-business-loans" href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/secured-business-loans"><strong>Our Secured Loans are available for applications between £50k and £500k on either a short or long-term basis, with flexible repayment schedules available.</strong></a></p>

<p>It's important to note that the type of business loan taken and its term duration will affect interest rates. It's crucial to think about the best option for the current circumstance and business in question.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h3><strong>The Benefits of Business Loans</strong></h3>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p><a href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/business-loans"><strong>A secured business loan</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;is one of the most popular and well-known methods of financing for small and medium enterprises</strong>.</p>

<p>It’s incredible useful when it comes to buying much-needed assets such as equipment or even a commercial property, securing the cost of equipment or machinery throughout the repayment period.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With this, businesses know exactly how much they are expected to pay without fluctuations, helping to improve their overall cash flow while securing new machinery. With flexible financing options and monthly repayments, it’s much easier to budget with this kind of solution rather than taking out a mainstream bank loan.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p><a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/asset-finance" href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/asset-finance">Using an asset refinancing solution can be a great way for your clients to access the value of assets</a> on their business' balance sheet and put it to good use somewhere else.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So when it comes to taking plans to the next level - without having to sacrifice savings - this is a popular finance product with a wealth of benefits.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Refinancing can be used to unlock vital amounts of cash in 'hard assets' they already own, freeing up capital that can be used to fund new and exciting ways to grow their business.&nbsp;</p>

<p>From brand-new pieces of equipment to simply reducing monthly outgoings, refinancing is a simple way to access funds exactly when - and where - it's required.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/about-us" href="https://timefinance.com/about-us">At Time Finance, we use a holistic approach to match your clients with the best solution for their needs.</a> Our refinancing products not only consider their plans for the immediate future but for long-term goals, helping them go from strength to strength with a solution that's structured for their exact needs.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>
	<br>
</h4>

<p><strong>Looking to get started?</strong></p>

<p>Get in touch with one of our Broker Managers today. We'd be more than happy to help.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h2><strong>So what is asset refinancing, exactly?&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>Basically, refinancing involves borrowing funds from existing assets, such as equipment and machinery, as collateral. It sits under the wider umbrella term of asset finance, so named for the different types of asset that can be used to unlock funds on behalf of a business.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/clients/category/asset-finance" href="https://timefinance.com/clients/category/asset-finance">Your client's business can benefit from this type of financing if they are looking to increase their access to overall working capital,</a> improve cash flow and make exciting strategic investments to support growth plans.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>
	<br>
</h3>

<h3><strong>What kind of company assets can be used?</strong></h3>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>To unlock a workable amount of capital, your client's business will usually have valuable assets that can be borrowed against.</p>

<p><a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/asset-finance" href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/asset-finance">These are usually classed as 'hard' or tangible assets - meaning they are physical things like equipment or machinery&nbsp;</a>- which can be used by the team at Time Finance to release capital to be used to fund growth.</p>

<p>Assets come in all shapes and sizes, but are most commonly things like:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Commercial vehicles&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Machinery&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Equipment</li>
</ul>

<p>Any of these can be used as part of an asset refinance agreement, which allows a business to borrow sums of money that are 'secured' against their asset's value.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Similarly to other forms of asset finance, the more 'valuable' an asset is, the more capital you will be able to use against it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p><strong>Industries we can assist</strong></p>

<p>Thanks to the flexible nature of asset refinancing, there are many businesses across multiple sectors that can benefit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At Time Finance, we've helped companies secure reliable funding for a number of industries,&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/time-blog/the-importance-of-cashflow" href="https://timefinance.com/time-blog/the-importance-of-cashflow">whether that's to pursue new avenues of production or simply improve cash flow.</a></p>

<p><a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/clients" href="https://timefinance.com/clients">Here are just a few of the sectors we've worked in:&nbsp;</a></p>

<ul>
	<li>Agriculture</li>
	<li>Construction</li>
	<li>Engineering</li>

	<li>Transport and logistics</li>
	<li>And many more</li>
</ul>

<p>So if your client needs a reliable appraisal on their assets to help them unlock equity, whether that's held in vehicles, equipment and more - we can help.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h2><strong>The benefits of asset refinance</strong></h2>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>When it comes to funding strategic growth opportunities, refinancing offers businesses the ability to access working capital on items that are already being used within their day-to-day operations.</p>

<p>Rather than accruing debt through other mainstream funding solutions, refinancing existing assets frees up capital that's readily available - rather than having to introduce new pieces of machinery, equipment and even vehicles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A flexible financing option is important for your clients as an intermediary. There are several scenarios where asset refinancing can be used, including:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Investing in new equipment or growth opportunities by releasing capital from existing assets</li>
	<li>Reducing interest rates and simplifying payments by consolidating debt</li>
	<li>Increase cash flow by unlocking value from non-generating assets</li>
</ul>

<p>As such,&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/time-blog/what-funding-stream-is-right-for-your-business" href="https://timefinance.com/time-blog/what-funding-stream-is-right-for-your-business">Asset Refinance is a highly effective way for businesses to free up the cash tied up in their existing business assets</a> - with a wide range of applications.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>
	<br>
</h3>

<p><strong>Turn existing assets into capital</strong></p>

<p>With asset refinancing, you can help your clients get access to a lump sum of capital much more quickly and cost-efficiently when compared to other forms of funding. This is because businesses can still put this capital to work while enjoying uninterrupted use of their assets.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p><strong>Invest in business with no limits</strong></p>

<p>Unlike <a href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/hire-purchase">hire purchase</a> or leasing agreements, unlocked capital can be used for a wide range of applications, from smoothing out cash flow to reinvestment in expansion, acquisitions or growth.</p>

<p>You'll know that freedom of choice is invaluable for businesses, so give your clients the ability to use this cash injection in a way that best suits them - making refinancing one of the most versatile funding solutions around.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p><strong>Unlocked potential</strong></p>

<p>With refinancing, your client still retains all of the benefits that come with using the asset, without disruption to the business. Releasing this capital can help people make faster decisions when it comes to getting the most out of existing strategies or upcoming growth, ensuring their existing assets go the extra mile when it counts.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p><strong>Budget with confidence</strong></p>

<p>One of the main benefits of asset financing is the fact that any capital can be repaid in fixed, affordable chunks that make planning simple and straightforward.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/vision-and-values" href="https://timefinance.com/vision-and-values">At Time Finance, we provide structured repayment schemes that help businesses get the most from their facility,</a> keeping their plans for growth in mind when it counts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p><strong>Refinance single or multiple assets</strong></p>

<p>Working capital can be increased to support expansion plans by refinancing multiple assets at ones. With a financial facility that can be scaled to suit your client's plans exactly, refinancing can provide flexible, tailored support that makes a huge difference - by simply using the assets already available.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h2><strong>So, how does it work?</strong></h2>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>With asset refinancing, Time Finance will buy the equipment on behalf of a business - whether that’s vehicles, machines or other hard assets - for a certain price.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These are then ‘loaned’ back to the business for a set monthly payment, offering straightforward budgeting rather than having to foot the bill by dipping into existing savings.</p>

<p>Your client continues to reap the benefits of your assets' production and efficiency while also producing extra income for your company's requirements and future expansion plans.</p>

<p>
	<br>

		<content><![CDATA[<p>In this guide,&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/our-team" href="https://timefinance.com/our-team">our experts will give you everything you need to know about reverse factoring.</a></p>

<p>This is a collaborative financing method available to businesses that has a number of benefits. It can improve cash flow, assist with budgets, and most importantly, make growth plans a reality.</p>

<p>Unlike other invoice finance products, this solution provides extra support for suppliers and businesses directly.</p>

<p>It does this by utilising a 3rd party finance provider that pays the producer on behalf of the buyer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This means a business can get on with the day-to-day running of its operations without worrying about its cash flow situation and the supplier receives a smoother experience - accelerating receivables with lower-cost financing.</p>

<p>However, it's crucial to understand the ins and outs of this form of finance before making any decisions.</p>

<p>But how do you know which solution is best for you? And<a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/time-blog/what-funding-stream-is-right-for-your-business" href="https://timefinance.com/time-blog/what-funding-stream-is-right-for-your-business">&nbsp;how can you decide which one is best for your particular needs and future goals?</a></p>

<p>In this guide, we'll give you everything you need to know about the reverse factoring process, touching on:</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<ul>
	<li>What is reverse factoring?
		<br>
		<br>
	</li>
	<li>What is the difference between a traditional factoring service and the reverse?
		<br>
		<br>
	</li>
	<li>What are the benefits?
		<br>
		<br>
	</li>
	<li>What kind of businesses can access it?
		<br>
		<br>
	</li>
	<li>And much more!</li>
</ul>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>Let's get into it.</p>

<h2>
	<br>
</h2>

<h2><strong>What does reverse factoring mean?</strong></h2>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>In finance, factoring is usually when an external party buys or manages a debt or invoice from a business or company.</p>

<p><a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/disclosed-confidential-invoice-finance" href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/disclosed-confidential-invoice-finance">Most markets consider factoring to be a form of invoice discounting,&nbsp;</a>as the two share a number of similarities, but factoring specifically involves transferring ownership of accounts to another party.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This party is then responsible for chasing up the debt.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p><strong>But how does this relate to reverse factoring?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Well, reverse factoring - also known as supply chain financing - is when a finance company, such as a lender or bank, places itself between a business and its suppliers. Instead of chasing up outstanding invoices from customers, the lender will pay the supplier directly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In these instances, the invoice is paid at an accelerated rate in exchange for a discount - making it a less costly way to boost accounts receivable receipts for suppliers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This accelerated cash flow takes the strain off business' when it comes to maintaining crucial relationships with suppliers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It can also streamline communications between the two as the lender will pay the invoice as early as possible, so no one is chasing up outstanding payments.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h2><strong>So, how does the Reverse Factoring Process work?</strong></h2>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>If you're thinking about exploring a reverse factoring platform, it's important to get a full understanding of how it works.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A reverse factoring plan is often established by a company who makes sure their supplier is happy with this method of payment. Then it's business as usual, with a company receiving their order from their chosen supplier and approving the invoice.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The supplier will then 'sell' the unpaid invoice to a 3rd party finance provider at a discounted rate, in exchange for a speedy payment.</p>

<p>This means that the lender can advance up to 100% of the full value of the invoice to the supplier as soon as it is raised.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p><strong>But what about the business?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Well, they will have already negotiated the terms of the agreement with the lender, often to increase the length of time needed to pay the full invoice.&nbsp;</p>

<p>They then pay the financial provider the value of the invoice, plus interest - thus completing the 'supply chain'.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With this solution, suppliers get super-quick payments for their services without chasing invoices and businesses don't have to worry about footing large bills while keeping operations moving.</p>

<h2>
	<br>
</h2>

<h2><strong>What is the main difference between traditional factoring and reverse factoring?</strong></h2>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>As we touched on earlier, although supply chain finance sits within invoice finance and can look similar, the two have some big differences.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>
	<br>
</h3>

<h3><strong>Invoice finance methods</strong></h3>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>In the majority of invoice finance methods, often the whole value of the invoice is free for factoring. This is in contrast to the discounted amount that is on offer through a normal factoring deal.</p>

<p><a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance" href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance">Invoice financing also requires a lender to provide up to 90% of an unpaid invoice to the supplier of goods that have been delivered to a business.</a> Whoever took out this loan is then responsible for recouping the value of their invoice to pay back the finance provider, as well as any of the chasing and admin that might involve.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, as it is the business that sets up the arrangement and is solely responsible for paying it back, customers don't need to be aware of their involvement - unless a business decides to get the assistance of a credit controller.</p>

<p>On the other hand, reverse factoring involves the business paying up to 100% of an unpaid invoice directly to the supplier. This is because the business is the one that sets up the arrangement with the supplier's say-so - and also agrees to pay back the sum of the invoice plus interest.</p>

<h2>

</h2>

<h2><strong>What are the benefits of reverse factoring?</strong></h2>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Improved cash flow -&nbsp;</strong>Reverse factoring closes that gap between payments and invoices, meaning that businesses who offer it to suppliers may be able to negotiate better terms. This includes cheaper and longer payment schedules as well as the improvement of working capital. <a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/time-blog/the-importance-of-cashflow" href="https://timefinance.com/time-blog/the-importance-of-cashflow">Businesses can take full advantage of their discounted cash flow</a> while enjoying plenty of time to pay the outstanding invoice.
		<br>
		<br>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Room to plan&nbsp;</strong>- As in any industry, a supplier knowing when they will be paid greatly improves their ability to plan for the future. For businesses, it becomes easier to budget and schedule payments alongside day-to-day operation costs.
		<br>
		<br>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Boost your balance sheets -&nbsp;</strong>Reverse-factoring improves both suppliers and business’ balance sheets as it is an off-balance sheet finance option. By enabling faster and cheaper access to future financing, suppliers can improve their cash flow and working capital.
		<br>
		<br>
	</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Which businesses can utilise this solution?&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>Reverse factoring is typically only available to larger businesses with established relationships with suppliers, however, it can be used across a number of sectors.</p>

<p>For smaller businesses, reverse factoring is rarely used because it takes time to set up a new supplier in a company's system - which can make the process much longer overall.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To get a supplier to agree to take part in reverse factoring often relies on a good existing working relationship, which, combined with the time it can take to source a 3rd party supplier can cause issues for smaller companies.&nbsp;</p>

		<content><![CDATA[<p>In this guide,&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/our-team" href="https://timefinance.com/our-team">our experts will give you everything you need to know about reverse factoring.</a></p>

<p>This is a collaborative financing method available to businesses that has a number of benefits. It can improve cash flow, assist with budgets, and most importantly, make growth plans a reality.</p>

<p>Unlike other invoice finance products, this solution provides extra support for suppliers and businesses directly.</p>

<p>It does this by utilising a 3rd party finance provider that pays the producer on behalf of the buyer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This means a business can get on with the day-to-day running of its operations without worrying about its cash flow situation and the supplier receives a smoother experience - accelerating receivables with lower-cost financing.</p>

<p>However, it's crucial to understand the ins and outs of this form of finance before making any decisions.</p>

<p>But how do you know which solution is best for you? And<a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/time-blog/what-funding-stream-is-right-for-your-business" href="https://timefinance.com/time-blog/what-funding-stream-is-right-for-your-business">&nbsp;how can you decide which one is best for your particular needs and future goals?</a></p>

<p>In this guide, we'll give you everything you need to know about the reverse factoring process, touching on:</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<ul>
	<li>What is reverse factoring?
		<br>
		<br>
	</li>
	<li>What is the difference between a traditional factoring service and the reverse?
		<br>
		<br>
	</li>
	<li>What are the benefits?
		<br>
		<br>
	</li>
	<li>What kind of businesses can access it?
		<br>
		<br>
	</li>
	<li>And much more!</li>
</ul>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>Let's get into it.</p>

<h2>
	<br>
</h2>

<h2><strong>What does reverse factoring mean?</strong></h2>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>In finance, factoring is usually when an external party buys or manages a debt or invoice from a business or company.</p>

<p><a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/disclosed-confidential-invoice-finance" href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/disclosed-confidential-invoice-finance">Most markets consider factoring to be a form of invoice discounting,&nbsp;</a>as the two share a number of similarities, but factoring specifically involves transferring ownership of accounts to another party.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This party is then responsible for chasing up the debt.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p><strong>But how does this relate to reverse factoring?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Well, reverse factoring - also known as supply chain financing - is when a finance company, such as a lender or bank, places itself between a business and its suppliers. Instead of chasing up outstanding invoices from customers, the lender will pay the supplier directly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In these instances, the invoice is paid at an accelerated rate in exchange for a discount - making it a less costly way to boost accounts receivable receipts for suppliers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This accelerated cash flow takes the strain off business' when it comes to maintaining crucial relationships with suppliers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It can also streamline communications between the two as the lender will pay the invoice as early as possible, so no one is chasing up outstanding payments.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h2><strong>So, how does the Reverse Factoring Process work?</strong></h2>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>If you're thinking about exploring a reverse factoring platform, it's important to get a full understanding of how it works.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A reverse factoring plan is often established by a company who makes sure their supplier is happy with this method of payment. Then it's business as usual, with a company receiving their order from their chosen supplier and approving the invoice.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The supplier will then 'sell' the unpaid invoice to a 3rd party finance provider at a discounted rate, in exchange for a speedy payment.</p>

<p>This means that the lender can advance up to 100% of the full value of the invoice to the supplier as soon as it is raised.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p><strong>But what about the business?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Well, they will have already negotiated the terms of the agreement with the lender, often to increase the length of time needed to pay the full invoice.&nbsp;</p>

<p>They then pay the financial provider the value of the invoice, plus interest - thus completing the 'supply chain'.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With this solution, suppliers get super-quick payments for their services without chasing invoices and businesses don't have to worry about footing large bills while keeping operations moving.</p>

<h2>
	<br>
</h2>

<h2><strong>What is the main difference between traditional factoring and reverse factoring?</strong></h2>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>As we touched on earlier, although supply chain finance sits within invoice finance and can look similar, the two have some big differences.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>
	<br>
</h3>

<h3><strong>Invoice finance methods</strong></h3>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>In the majority of invoice finance methods, often the whole value of the invoice is free for factoring. This is in contrast to the discounted amount that is on offer through a normal factoring deal.</p>

<p><a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance" href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance">Invoice financing also requires a lender to provide up to 90% of an unpaid invoice to the supplier of goods that have been delivered to a business.</a> Whoever took out this loan is then responsible for recouping the value of their invoice to pay back the finance provider, as well as any of the chasing and admin that might involve.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, as it is the business that sets up the arrangement and is solely responsible for paying it back, customers don't need to be aware of their involvement - unless a business decides to get the assistance of a credit controller.</p>

<h3>
	<br>
</h3>

<h3><strong>Reverse factoring</strong></h3>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>On the other hand, reverse factoring involves the business paying up to 100% of an unpaid invoice directly to the supplier. This is because the business is the one that sets up the arrangement with the supplier's say-so - and also agrees to pay back the sum of the invoice plus interest.</p>

<h2>
	<br>
</h2>

<h2><strong>What are the benefits of reverse factoring?</strong></h2>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Improved cash flow -&nbsp;</strong>Reverse factoring closes that gap between payments and invoices, meaning that businesses who offer it to suppliers may be able to negotiate better terms. This includes cheaper and longer payment schedules as well as the improvement of working capital. <a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/time-blog/the-importance-of-cashflow" href="https://timefinance.com/time-blog/the-importance-of-cashflow">Businesses can take full advantage of their discounted cash flow</a> while enjoying plenty of time to pay the outstanding invoice.

		<content><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://timefinance.com/">Time Finance</a><u>,</u> the alternative finance provider to UK SMEs, has achieved another lending milestone with the delivery of its first Asset Based Lending (ABL) facility.</p>

<p>The company, which is committed to providing flexible and innovative solutions to businesses across the UK, packaged and delivered a £1.1million ABL facility to a growing engineering firm specialising in steelwork, manufacturing and installation. The funds will be used to provide core working capital which will be essential in helping the engineering firm to take on new contracts and increase its turnover to £10million in 2023.</p>

<p><strong>Phil Chesham, Managing Director of Invoice Finance, at Time Finance, said:</strong> “Completing our first Asset Based Lending facility is a great achievement for Time Finance and one that further underlines the appetite we have to provide comprehensive funding solutions to businesses of all sizes through combined facilities.</p>

<p>“We believe that Asset Based Lending is the future of business finance. Today’s SME requires a solution that gives them the opportunity to release working capital and provide headroom for growth. By leveraging the assets already within their business, our solutions can do just that.”</p>

<p>The £1.1million facility comprised a £650,000 Invoice Finance facility and £450,000 Property Loan.

		<updated><![CDATA[2023-05-12 07:55:30]]></updated>
		<content><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%;"><span>The weather is warming up and with
Spring in bloom, businesses are starting to see new shoots of economic
optimism. The struggles faced over the winter period - from increased overheads
to staff and skills shortages - may not be completely behind us just yet, but
as we move further into the year, many businesses are ready to dust off those
investment plans and consider alternative finance solutions in helping to bring
those plans to life.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%;"><strong><span style="font-size:13.0pt;line-height:150%;">The
budget springs new optimism on SMEs</span></strong></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%;"><span>With the arrival of Spring comes a new
sense of optimism and confidence for businesses. In the Spring Statement
earlier this year, the Chancellor shared the good news of a recession avoided
and inflation predicted to more than halve by the end of 2023. Whilst it
brought a collective sigh of relief, for businesses there was more good news to
come. Measures were announced to help SMEs up and down the country take their
next step forward in innovation, sustainability and to help gain the staff and
skills they need.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%;"><strong><span style="font-size:13.0pt;">Government policies helping businesses
to sow the seed for investment</span></strong></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%;"><span style="color:#0F0F0F;">There were lots of headline grabbers in this year’s
Spring Statement, but one of the biggest of all was the Office for Budget Responsibility’s
(OBR) predictions that the UK will not enter a technical recession in 2023.
Narrowly avoiding a recession this Spring brings with it the prospect of a
steadier economy in the next financial year, making now the perfect time for
businesses to act on their investment plans with confidence.&nbsp;</span><span>In his Spring Statement, the Chancellor
talked about the need for risk-taking to advance our businesses, our economy,
boost productivity and create new jobs. Here are just a few of the measures
introduced which will impact businesses:</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%;"><strong><span>Capital
Expensing&nbsp;</span></strong></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%;"><span>Full capital expensing was brought in
which aims to give businesses the confidence to make those all important
investments in technology, so they can grow and prosper.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%;"><strong><span>Employment
Support&nbsp;</span></strong></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%;"><span>The introduction of&nbsp;</span>‘returnerships’ for the over 50s is set to encourage retirees back into the workforce.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%;"><strong><span>Sustainable
Tax Relief</span></strong></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%;">In a bid to reduce business’ energy use by 15%, the Chancellor revealed a £60 million Climate Change Levy tax relief scheme on energy efficient measures for businesses.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%;"><strong><span style="font-size:13.0pt;line-height:150%;">Letting
confidence bloom</span></strong></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%;"><span>You may have noticed a number of new initiatives were introduced to promise greater investment in the workforce to try and help curb the increasing skills shortage and employment gaps. We hope this new focus should lift many stagnant businesses out of their lull and encourage them to invest, innovate and take their operations to the next level.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%;"><span>With business confidence comes the opportunity to flourish and with the right working capital, alongside support from the Government, now is the perfect time to do so. Alternative solutions at Time Finance can support a business in a number of different ways whether that’s <a></a><a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance">Invoice Finance,</a>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/asset-finance"><span>Asset

	<!--[endif]--><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%;"><strong><span style="font-size:13.0pt;">Nurturing your investment</span></strong></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%;"><span>While the Government’s new initiatives
aim to support businesses,<span style="color:#E06666;">&nbsp;</span>having access to the right financial solutions alongside this will be vital. Specific tax reliefs and support for the economy is welcome news, but for those businesses needing a cash injection and tailored financial support now, alternative finance packages will be the answer. Whether specific multi-product packages or solutions which meet a more individual need, alternative finance can help to shape business’ growth plans and enable them to take the necessary next steps.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%;"><span>What the last few years have taught us
is that businesses need to expect the unexpected, keep on their toes and always
have sound financial planning in place - in preparation for any unexpected
bumps in the road. We at Time Finance are on hand to support business' cashflow
problems, asset and equipment investments and help with any invoice delays. At
Time Finance, we consider flexibility and a tailored approach to be absolutely
vital to the support we give to businesses, and we work hard to truly
understand a business before embarking on a package solution to suit their very
specific needs.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%;"><span>While the economy is not yet out of the
woods, there are lots of reasons to be confident. Equipped with the right
financial solutions and an increased confidence from the Spring Statement this
puts businesses in a great position, giving them the legroom they need to make
bolder choices, take new risks and contribute to economic growth.&nbsp;</span>

		<content><![CDATA[<p>As we approach Mental Health Awareness Week, here at Time Finance we’re taking the time to talk, open up conversations around workplace mental health and understand how SMEs are being impacted.</p>

<p>For so many businesses, financial strain can be a cause of mental health issues. Thankfully, we know lenders can help curb these worries by providing a friendly and flexible approach to financing. We dedicate our effort to truly supporting SMEs and setting them on the right track to reduce the trouble. But it all starts with a conversation.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.smeweb.com/2023/05/02/uk-small-business-owners-struggle-with-low-levels-of-wellbeing/">SME Guidance For Business Growth</a>, Small business owners in the UK struggle with significantly lower levels of wellbeing with only 26% feeling they can rarely, if ever, take a break from their business. With the problem worsening year on year, it’s important businesses begin to break the parallels between poor mental health and financial anxiety. By sitting down with their finances - and a trusted lender - they can work out how to use tailored financial packages to suit their specific business challenges.</p>

<p><strong>Tackling the root causes&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Waning mental wellbeing can wreak havoc on a business’ success, so it’s important to uncover the root cause and find ways to combat this. In a recent Time Finance survey, we found the most common pressure point keeping business owners awake at night was money - with 47% claiming rising costs specifically, and a further 35% claiming a lack of cash in the company.</p>

<p>With issues such as late payment rising due to an unsteady economy, concerns around cashflow and having access to working capital will continue to be front of mind for those struggling to maintain an optimistic mindset.</p>

<p>But it’s vital we find ways to preserve positive thinking. The true impact of poor mental health is staggering: it holds back innovation, halts business confidence and can stop so many firms taking on new challenges, investing in new product lines and grasping hold of new opportunities.</p>

<p><strong>Breaking the stigma&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>While SMEs are undoubtedly worried about their finances, 75% of our business community told us they felt now is a good time to invest. Finding the right financial solutions to support these investments will be the answer to reducing the heightened pressure, and helping tackle any associated mental health concerns.</p>

<p>62% of businesses claimed they are not comfortable talking about their finances, and many consider financial options such as invoice financing and loans to be a last resort. We must break this stigma in order for businesses to benefit from these solutions and take their operations to the next level, without the headache.</p>

<p>Our industry plays a vital role in supporting SMEs during times of financial crisis. A reliable and transparent lender can equip business owners with the financial knowledge and confidence they need to thrive. At Time Finance we offer our business community a flexible and mindful approach to financing solutions. We’re here to help SMEs open up the conversation around their finances and the future of their business. <a href="https://timefinance.com/contact">Get in touch</a> to start the conversation.</p>]]></content>

		<slug><![CDATA[learning-at-work-week-i-swapped-the-classroom-for-the-office-but-im-not-done-learning]]></slug>
		<published><![CDATA[2023-05-16 08:00:02]]></published>
		<updated><![CDATA[2023-05-16 08:00:02]]></updated>
		<content><![CDATA[<p>At Time Finance we’re huge advocates for employee development and investing in the next generation; we’re committed to nurturing talent from within through tailored development programmes that get the very best out of our people. For us, learning is a constant process.</p>

<p>As we look ahead to Learning at Work Week, we sat down with our Credit Controller and winner of Time Finance’s 2023 Rising Star Award, Jack Johnson, who at the age of 16 is the youngest member of the Time Finance team. We got his thoughts on what workplace learning means to him and the real benefits of learning on-the-job.</p>

<p><strong>How long have you been at Time Finance?</strong></p>

<p>“I’ve been with the business ever since I left school, nearly 10 months ago. I’m working as a Credit Controller in our Invoice Finance department and it’s my job to check in with our client’s customers and make sure their invoice payments are made swiftly. It’s an important job and I’m really grateful that Time Finance has given me the opportunity to take it on at my age.”</p>

<p><strong>What skills do you think are typically valued in your role?</strong></p>

<p>“Being a team player is really important, but it’s also about communication, being friendly and a people person. It goes a long way. In my role I spend a lot of time on the phone to our customers, making sure payments are on track and raising any potential issues with the team, to make sure things don’t slip through the net.”</p>

<p><strong>Why do you think you were selected for Time Finance’s Rising Star Award?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>“I was really proud to win this award. I feel passionate about what I do and not many people can say that at my age. It’s about putting things in place to get where you want to be and have the job that you want, and not many 16 year olds are already doing that. It was great to see my work was recognised by the team!”</p>

<p><strong>Why do you think it’s important for young professionals like yourself to have opportunities to learn at work?</strong></p>

<p>“Having this opportunity to learn on the job has just been a great boost for my early career. I feel really lucky to be learning at work at my age - and I’ve definitely got a head start on my mates.</p>

<p>“When I finished my GCSEs last year, I needed to decide what to do next. I knew I didn’t want to be in the classroom anymore and what I really wanted was to get myself into the world of work, to get some life experiences and get my foot in the door.</p>

<p>“Leaving school and going straight into the workplace was the best thing I ever did. It’s given me so many new opportunities that I wouldn't get at college. My friends all say it was the perfect decision for me personally. I definitely thrive more by learning on-the-job”</p>

<p><strong>Have you had opportunities for professional development or training in your career so far, and how has this impacted your work?</strong></p>

<p>“In the 10 months that I’ve been with Time Finance there have been loads of opportunities to develop. Just because I was finished with the classroom, doesn’t mean I’m finished learning.</p>

<p>“I’m currently working towards qualifying for my Invoice Finance and Asset Based Lending Foundation course. It’s all online so I can easily split my time between my work and studying for my exam, which I’ll be sitting next month. Juggling them both at the same time is definitely a challenge, but one that I’ve been excited to take on.”</p>

<p><strong>What ways do you see your current role and the opportunities within it helping you to achieve your future career aspirations?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>“Once I’ve completed my Foundation course there will be so many routes to go down. At this point I’m keen to just get my head down, keep going and see where it all takes me.</p>

<p>“There are quite a few people in the business that I have been shadowing, such as my manager Lisa Boyd, and Invoice Finance Managing Director Phil Chesham. They give me regular check-ins and feedback, which has been great. Having that close contact with people across the business has meant that I’ve received some great insight and helps me to ask them questions and get to know their jobs better. I’ve also been trusted to join client meetings, which is a big deal and a huge responsibility. All these experiences just benefit me further in my career and help me to learn even more.</p>

<p>“The way I see it, there will always be new things to learn - even later on in your career - but having someone there to guide me has been really great.”</p>

<p><strong>Finding the tools for growth</strong></p>

<p>At Time Finance, every member of our team is valued and provided with the time, investment and resources they need for continued learning and progressing at their own pace. It’s something that we consider key to the future of our people but also our business. By investing in them we are helping Time Finance remain agile in an ever-changing landscape.</p>]]></content>

		<slug><![CDATA[time-finance-and-open-invoice-finance-deliver-11million-asset-based-lending-facility]]></slug>

		<updated><![CDATA[2023-05-30 09:13:11]]></updated>
		<content><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://timefinance.com/">Time Finance</a> and <a href="https://openinvoicefinance.co.uk/">Open InVoice Finance</a> are pleased to announce that they have delivered a £1.1million Asset Based Lending (ABL) facility to aid the expansion of a growing steel structural engineering firm in the South East of England.</p>

<p>The business’s financial consultant, Open InVoice Finance, was brought on board to assist the engineering firm in finding an asset-based lender, after its existing funder had exited the market. Open InVoice Finance introduced the business to Time Finance’s ABL team, who worked in partnership to produce and deliver the seven-figure funding line. The ABL facility is designed to release essential working capital to provide the firm with the necessary headroom to take on new contracts confidently.</p>

<p>The £1.1million facility comprised a £650,000 Invoice Finance facility and £450,000 Property Loan. By leveraging the assets already within the business, they can access the essential funds needed to take on and finance 8 additional contracts which will help them to achieve their goal of generating £10million turnover this year.</p>

<p><strong>John Dodsworth of Open InVoice Finance said:</strong> “We are thrilled to have supported this business with Time Finance’s assistance. It was a complex deal with tight deadlines requiring a funder who understands the engineering industry, the challenges they commonly face and to provide a bespoke solution that supports their unique goals. Time Finance was able to do just that. As a reliable, pro-active, and solution-driven funding provider, I’m pleased to see our client with a committed funder by their side.”</p>

<p>Asset Based Lending provides SMEs with an opportunity to drive growth plans and support day-to-day business expenses, such as paying suppliers, HMRC, purchasing stock and materials, and paying employee wages. By leveraging the assets within the business, including invoices, stock, and property, businesses can overcome cash flow challenges and access essential working capital.</p>

<p><strong>Dave Nurcombe, Business Development Manager at Time Finance, said:</strong> “Delivering our first Asset Based Lending facility with Open InVoice Finance is a great achievement. It was a real effort, and it was great to see that the dedication and hard work of all those involved did not go unrecognised. The client's gratitude was testament to our responsive and flexible approach, as we were able to really get under the skin of the business and give them the confidence that we can be that stable and supportive funder they need to take their business to new heights.”</p>

<p>Time Finance specialises in providing funding solutions to UK businesses looking to access finance and realise their growth plans. Its diverse portfolio includes Asset Finance, Invoice Finance, Loans, and Vehicle Finance, providing businesses with the flexibility to select the best option for their needs, or combine those facilities through its new Asset Based Lending product. Facilities up to £2.5 million are available, providing support for businesses of all sizes.</p>]]></content>

Essentially, we want to listen to their story and understand how we can use our funding to help make it a success.</em></p>

Whether it’s attending networking events or client visits, it’s great to get around and meet new people.

		<slug><![CDATA[financing-the-future-world-environmental-day]]></slug>
		<published><![CDATA[2023-06-07 12:56:03]]></published>
		<updated><![CDATA[2023-06-07 12:56:03]]></updated>
		<content><![CDATA[<p>“Going green” in business isn’t always as simple as it sounds. For firms to truly meet demands - from stakeholders and customers - for greener product lines and eco-friendly business models, thorough planning and investment is required.</p>

<p>In a week that plays host to World Environmental Day, we’re discussing the importance of sustainability in a business and the role that alternative financing can play in making it a success. Beating plastic pollution is this year’s initiative, and with many food and beverage businesses facing a single-use plastic ban, now is the perfect time to be putting plans into action and making investments into sustainability.</p>

<p><strong>Why it matters</strong></p>

<p>Aside from the very central and critical environmental concerns, there are so many reasons that businesses should consider their green credentials. Consumers are becoming much more conscious of their buying choices. In a recent survey we asked our networks if they would be more encouraged to buy from a business that was plastic free. ‘Yes’ was a clear winner from 75% of respondents, and so the decision for businesses is obvious; switching to plastic-free is about staying competitive, responding to consumers’ buying choices and succeeding as a result.</p>

<p><strong>Putting sustainability back on the agenda</strong></p>

<p>In a year that has offered SMEs more certainty than the last, many businesses are fit and fighting, ready to take on new challenges and move investment back up the list of financial priorities. But the fact remains that many firms are still struggling with the aftershocks of an unsettled economy. The reality is that enhancing sustainability and reducing plastic use are not in easy reach for everyone.</p>

<p><strong>Financing the shift for SMEs&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>This October the Government will be introducing new legislation that will impose a far-reaching ban on single-use plastics in England. For the many food and beverage businesses in the SME space, this means that supplying environmentally friendly products, and in-turn using a greener supply chain, is now absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>Whether businesses opt for recycled or reusable products, the move to become plastic-free will come at a much higher cost to businesses. For the estimated 143,000 of hospitality businesses in the UK, leveraging alternative finance solutions can inject vital capital to enable this shift, helping them to respond to the outside world and consumer demands - but without impacting their bottom line.</p>

<p>Flexible solutions such as <a href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/asset-based-lending">Asset Based Lending</a>, <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/asset-finance">Asset Finance</a> and <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/loans">Loans</a> give SMEs an invaluable cash injection and support system to meet the financial demands of CSR initiatives. Just recently we supported Norwich-based energy consultancy, <a href="https://timefinance.com/clients/indigo-swans-sustainability-strategy-takes-flight-after-securing-six-figure-funding-boost">Indigo Swan,</a> with a six-figure invoice finance facility, which was in-part designed to help introduce new technology, processes and systems to streamline the energy procurement process and enable businesses to reduce their energy consumption and environmental impact. At Time Finance we’re determined to support every business that we can in their next venture. Investment for growth will always be the true benefit of alternative finance, but equally exciting is alternative finance’s role in investing for change.</p>]]></content>

		<slug><![CDATA[rising-star-niamh-gildart-there-is-always-something-new-to-learn-and-that-makes-it-so-fulfilling]]></slug>
		<published><![CDATA[2023-06-23 09:00:22]]></published>
		<updated><![CDATA[2023-06-23 09:00:22]]></updated>
		<content><![CDATA[<p>Nurturing talent within our business is so important for us here at Time Finance. So, we sat down with Niamh Gildart, Sales Support Executive, and one of Time’s Rising Stars, to get her thoughts on learning in the workplace and her career with Time.</p>

<p><strong>When did you join the business and what roles have you taken on in that time?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>I joined Time Finance in February 2020, just before lockdown, so remote working was introduced very early on in my career. That wasn’t easy but I was guided by a really supportive team and they always found ways to support my learning – it included lots of video calls!</p>

<p>In my role as a Sales Support Executive, I support broker managers and brokers with new business enquiries and supporting their proposals, all the way to providing finance. I get to work on our deals from beginning to end, which is really rewarding. I’m currently studying for a Level 2 Customer Service Practitioner qualification, which I’m completing alongside my day job; I study a couple of hours a week, which allows me to do my coursework, which is supported by visits from my college advisor. It works really well.</p>

<p><strong>What does it mean to you to have been selected for Time Finance’s Rising Star Award?</strong></p>

<p>I was really proud to have been selected as one of Time Finance’s Rising Stars. I love my job and I’m passionate about furthering my knowledge and progressing my career. To have that recognised was amazing.</p>

<p><strong>What would you say the best part about your role is?</strong></p>

<p>I love working in a team; we have a great dynamic and the people I work with have always been supportive of me, but they’ve also made my learning journey fun. The job itself means that I have a lot of day-to-day interactions with different people, and that’s something I really enjoy. The work itself is also a big plus; when you realise that you have been a small part in helping a business to grow, that feels amazing.</p>

<p><strong>What do you think it takes to be successful in your role?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>We spend a lot of time interacting with brokers and customers, helping them to get deals done smoothly and efficiently, so being personable, approachable and friendly is essential. Having a keen attention to detail is also valuable; in a sales support role we’re responsible for ensuring that minimal errors are made, which could delay a deal, so being organised and thorough helps avoid this. Being a team player is so important too. We support everyone involved in a deal and so we all need to pull in the same direction. At Time, it’s great to know that I’m surrounded by people that are all striving towards a common goal.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p><strong>What advice would you give to anybody looking to get noticed in the workplace?</strong></p>

<p>Don’t be afraid to go the extra mile, whether that be taking on more responsibility, helping out a colleague or going the extra mile for a customer. A little help can go a long way. Don’t be afraid to take on something that challenges you because it helps to build experience.</p>

<p><strong>Is there anybody/thing that inspires you professionally?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>I can’t say that there is one specific person that inspires me professionally, but I am lucky to be surrounded by many inspiring women in business. I admire their achievements and ability to keep pushing professional boundaries. They guide me to make the best choices and support my growth and learning in the industry.</p>

<p><strong>Have you had any opportunities for professional development or training within the company so far, and if so, how have they impacted your work?</strong></p>

<p>As I mentioned, I’m currently working towards my Level 2 Customer Service Practitioner qualification, and I’m due to sit my final exams. This learning is mostly online, apart from a monthly meeting with a training advisor, which makes it easy to slot around my working day.</p>

<p>I’m required to complete up to 7 hours of off-the-job learning each week as part of the course, which gives me a great opportunity to learn about other aspects of the business and the industry in general. I’m hoping to move onto my next qualification as soon as this one is complete.</p>

<p><strong>In what way do you see your current role and the opportunities within it helping you to achieve your future career aspirations?</strong></p>

<p>Once I have completed my qualifications, there will be plenty of opportunities for me at Time. At the moment, I’m still learning; every day is different in my job role and there is always something new to learn, and that makes it so fulfilling. Even the more experienced people in the business will agree that there is always something new to learn or a new challenge to overcome. Having the support from my manager, Tina Hawkins, and the Head of Operations, Joe Ralphs, has been the best guidance I could have wished for. I’m passionate about progressing my career at Time Finance and with the support and shared drive of everyone here, I’m confident I can make that happen.</p>]]></content>

		<updated><![CDATA[2023-06-27 14:25:08]]></updated>
		<content><![CDATA[<p>As poor cash flow continues to pose a major challenge for SMEs, more and more intermediaries are turning to receivables factoring as a way to help stabilise their clients' finances - and inject crucial working capital.</p>

<p>This type of<a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance" href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance">&nbsp;invoice financing</a> gives businesses the power to access the value of outstanding customer invoices before they are due. As such, this extra facility can also offer freedom to businesses who are looking to pursue new avenues and grow, without being held back by late payments.</p>

<p>Through receivables factoring,<a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/" href="https://timefinance.com/">&nbsp;Time Finance works on behalf of hundreds of businesses to recoup revenue from outstanding invoices.</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We pay up to 90% of the value of the invoice within 24 hours, injecting working capital back into the business and improving overall cash flow.</p>

<p>At Time Finance, understanding the scale of the cash flow issues that businesses are facing is crucial to the service we provide.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In this guide, our experts will discuss the problem of poor cash flow and explain why receivable factoring might be the best solution for your clients.</p>

<h2>The late payment cycle affects the majority of UK businesses</h2>

<p>Poor cash flow may have worsened in recent years due to rising business costs, but<a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/time-blog/late-invoice-payments-what-to-do" href="https://timefinance.com/time-blog/late-invoice-payments-what-to-do">&nbsp;late payments from customers have long posed a major issue for businesses</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The vicious cycle of invoicing customers for products or services and receiving the payment late has a domino effect that prevents businesses from paying their bills, suppliers, and in the worst cases, even their own employees.</p>

<p>As the domino effect continues down the chain, more and more businesses are impacted.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This can cause viable businesses to go under, seen with&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/31/business-insolvencies-firms-go-bust-2022-england-wales" href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/31/business-insolvencies-firms-go-bust-2022-england-wales">around 22,000 businesses forced to fold in 2022 alone.</a></p>

<p><strong>But just how many businesses in the UK are actually impacted by the late payment cycle?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>According to our own research, the answer is much more than you might think.</p>

<p>In a recent review conducted by Time Finance to understand the financial challenges facing businesses,&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/press-releases/late-payments-cause-7-in-10-businesses-to-worry-about-cashflow" href="https://timefinance.com/press-releases/late-payments-cause-7-in-10-businesses-to-worry-about-cashflow">we found that 75% of UK businesses worry about cash flow</a> as a direct result of overdue invoices from their customers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Furthermore,&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/press-releases/late-payments-driving-uk-smes-towards-invoice-finance-reveals-time-finance-data" href="https://timefinance.com/press-releases/late-payments-driving-uk-smes-towards-invoice-finance-reveals-time-finance-data">SMEs are owed an average of £250,000 in unpaid invoices</a>, with some waiting up to 120 days for payments to come through.</p>

<p>So, how can businesses break free from the late payment cycle and overcome the problem of poor cash flow?&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is where reliable finance solutions such as receivable factoring come into play.</p>

<h2>Receivables factoring: What is it and how does it support cash flow?</h2>

<p>Receivable factoring (also known as<a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/invoice-factoring" href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/invoice-factoring">&nbsp;invoice factoring</a> or factoring receivables) is a useful finance solution that helps businesses to manage cash flow. It involves businesses selling their accounts receivables to a factoring company which then sends them the value of the outstanding invoice before it is due, helping the business to avoid cash flow issues.</p>

<p>In many cases, the factoring company will liaise with the customer directly to recoup the revenue from outstanding invoices and then pay the business the remaining value of the invoice minus their factoring fees, saving the business valuable time.</p>

<p>When harnessed as part of a long-term financial strategy, receivables financing can ensure that a business has an uninterrupted supply of working capital in the bank, regardless of credit histories and whether or not they're eligible for traditional loans. This means that businesses are able to inject their own money into their investment plans, whether that includes recruitment, skills development, marketing, or equipment.</p>

<p>Recent data from Time Finance shows the growing popularity of receivable financing amongst the B2B business community, with&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/press-releases/late-payments-driving-uk-smes-towards-invoice-finance-reveals-time-finance-data" href="https://timefinance.com/press-releases/late-payments-driving-uk-smes-towards-invoice-finance-reveals-time-finance-data">32% of financial intermediaries</a> stating that receivable factoring will be the most popular service to support cash flow this year.</p>

<p>It's no surprise that receivables factoring has grown so massively in popularity over recent months. The cost of doing business has risen exponentially, with 100% of SMEs now claiming that more of their customers are paying late due to increased overheads across the board. Receivable factoring offers a viable solution to the late payment cycle, giving businesses the support they need to grow.</p>

<p>This type of invoice factoring has been an ideal funding solution for helping businesses gain access to additional working capital, improve cash flow, and build in headroom for growth for a long time now. But it's a solution that only continues to grow in popularity as demand for finance rises and businesses seek support for overcoming their immediate<a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/time-blog/cash-flow-issues-in-business" href="https://timefinance.com/time-blog/cash-flow-issues-in-business">&nbsp;cash flow challenges</a>, as well as achieving their long-term goals.</p>

<p>With healthy funding lines that not only inject capital into the business but also grow alongside their operations, factoring receivables continues to be a flexible and effective way for firms to manage their cash flow and stay competitive in today's economy.</p>

		<content><![CDATA[<p>As poor cash flow continues to pose a major challenge for SMEs, more and more intermediaries are turning to receivables factoring as a way to help stabilise their clients' finances - and inject crucial working capital.</p>

<p>This type of<a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance" href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance">&nbsp;invoice financing</a> gives businesses the power to access the value of outstanding customer invoices before they are due. As such, this extra facility can also offer freedom to businesses who are looking to pursue new avenues and grow, without being held back by late payments.</p>

<p>Through receivables factoring,<a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/" href="https://timefinance.com/">&nbsp;Time Finance works on behalf of hundreds of businesses to recoup revenue from outstanding invoices.</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We pay up to 90% of the value of the invoice within 24 hours, injecting working capital back into the business and improving overall cash flow.</p>

<p>At Time Finance, understanding the scale of the cash flow issues that businesses are facing is crucial to the service we provide.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In this guide, our experts will discuss the problem of poor cash flow and explain why receivable factoring might be the best solution for your clients.</p>

<h2>The late payment cycle affects the majority of UK businesses</h2>

<p>Poor cash flow may have worsened in recent years due to rising business costs, but<a data-mce-href="https://timefinance.com/time-blog/late-invoice-payments-what-to-do" href="https://timefinance.com/time-blog/late-invoice-payments-what-to-do">&nbsp;late payments from customers have long posed a major issue for businesses</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The vicious cycle of invoicing customers for products or services and receiving the payment late has a domino effect that prevents businesses from paying their bills, suppliers, and in the worst cases, even their own employees.</p>

<p>As the domino effect continues down the chain, more and more businesses are impacted.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This can cause viable businesses to go under, seen with&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/31/business-insolvencies-firms-go-bust-2022-england-wales" href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/31/business-insolvencies-firms-go-bust-2022-england-wales">around 22,000 businesses forced to fold in 2022 alone.</a></p>

<p><strong>But just how many businesses in the UK are actually impacted by the late payment cycle?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>According to our own research, the answer is much more than you might think.</p>

		<content><![CDATA[<p>At Time Finance we know that our industry is full of opportunity, with diverse careers and huge potential for growth. We caught up with one of our Rising Stars, Rachel Best, to get her thoughts on what she loves about her role as Sales and Operations Executive in our Invoice Finance team.</p>

<p><strong>When did you join Time Finance and could you describe your current role?</strong></p>

<p>I started in October 2022, so just over eight months ago, which has gone really quickly. I work with sales and operations, and this involves all the steps of onboarding clients from beginning to end. When the sales team has a new business enquiry I will support the initial business searches, raise documents and process them as clients. I also work with the Relationship Managers to help our existing clients access new and additional facilities with us.</p>

<p><strong>What does it mean to you to have been selected for Time Finance’s Rising Star Award?</strong></p>

<p>It’s a big confidence boost. I’m still quite new to the industry and so it’s reassuring to know I’m doing the right thing. It also means a lot that I was nominated by colleagues. I know I have a lot to learn, and my best chance of that is showing willingness, working with the team and speaking up when I’m struggling - it’s how we get the job done. I like to set standards for myself, and I want to achieve those standards as well as everyone else’s. It means a lot to have that recognised.</p>

<p><strong>What would you say the best part about your role is?</strong></p>

<p>The best part is definitely the impact I can have on our clients. I work closely with them right from the start, up until they’re onboarded, and that gives me the chance to make a good first impression and build a strong relationship with Time Finance. I also get to work with - and learn from - a whole range of people in the company, which means I get to know everyone. Finance is new to me, but I have a lot of family that work in finance, and once you’re in it, a lot of people stay and that’s a credit to the industry.</p>

<p><strong>What do you think it takes to be successful in your role?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>It certainly helps if you enjoy working in a fast-paced environment. There are a lot of tasks to juggle and prioritise, so being able to communicate and build relationships with colleagues is also a plus. The nature of what we do means you can’t do everything all at once so you need to be able to speak up. Doing so gives people reassurance and confidence in you; it builds trust with colleagues and that’s so important.</p>

<p><strong>What advice would you give to anybody looking to get noticed in the workplace?</strong></p>

<p>Be yourself. If you try to be anyone else, people will see through it. Don’t ever do the bare minimum, don’t wait for someone to come to you, and always use your initiative. Being able to use initiative and show willingness proves that you’re driven.</p>

<p><strong>Is there anyone that inspires you professionally?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Working in the office and seeing the progression of colleagues is quite inspirational. A lot of the team at Time Finance have worked their way up, but you can also see them developing day-to-day and that makes you believe that you can do it as well.</p>

<p><strong>Have you had any opportunities for professional development or training within the company so far, and if so how have they impacted your work?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>I’m really keen on progression, and this is an open conversation at Time Finance, which is really good. The business is always saying ‘where do you want to go and how can we get you there?’. Because of this, the business knows what opportunities you’re looking for and there are options for development that will benefit both me and Time Finance.</p>

<p><strong>In what way do you see your current role and the opportunities within it helping you to achieve your future career aspirations?</strong></p>

<p>There are a lot of transferable skills in my current role. I understand client onboarding; I know what clients are looking for, and how the sales team are involved. I understand the process and that will help in other areas too. Working with everyone across the business has helped me build my knowledge of our processes and the industry in general, and I’ve also made fantastic connections that will help me in the future.</p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<p>Following a year of ambitious growth for the alternative SME lender, aim-listed <a href="https://timefinance.com/">Time Finance</a> has revealed all-time high annual trading results, with its gross lending book reaching a record £169m and profits up 273%.</p>

<p>Specialising in the provision of business funding solutions: <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/asset-finance">Asset Finance</a>, <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance">Invoice Finance</a>, <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/loans">Business Loans</a>, <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/vehicle-finance">Vehicle Finance</a> and <a href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/asset-based-lending">Asset Based Lending</a>, Time Finance supports some 10,000 UK businesses.</p>

<p>Illustrating the success and progression of the firm’s ongoing strategy, Time Finance has announced total revenue has risen by 16% to £27.4m. The firm also reports a significant increase in profit before tax, which has soared 273% to £4.1m. With an increased focus on new business, own-book lending origination rose by 14% to £73.4m.</p>

<p>Over the past year, the business has continued to expand its reach to UK SMEs with a considerable recruitment drive bringing a series of valuable appointments across the business, including the growth of the business’ Invoice Finance division, which is set to double the size of its sales team by the end of 2023.</p>

<p>The business has also strengthened its existing offering by investing in its nationwide teams, most notably in the launch of its new Invoice Finance office in Reading. In its Asset Finance division, the business has seen considerable growth in Hard Asset, with new business written up 20% on the previous year.</p>

<p>Throughout the year, Time Finance has continued to respond to the changing needs of SMEs by investing in developing new products and services<a name="_Hlk139540144">. Earlier this year, the firm launched a new Asset Based Lending (ABL) solution to facilitate business’ needs to unlock working capital from existing assets.</a></p>

<p>Its first ABL facility, valued at £1.1m and completed in April, demonstrated itself to be key funding option for businesses looking for flexible, multi-product services.</p>

<p><strong>Reflecting on a year which has taken the company from strength to strength, Ed Rimmer, Chief Executive Officer at Time Finance comments:</strong> “It’s been a rewarding year for the business as we announce a record lending book and a significant increase in our revenue and profits. I’m very pleased to be ending the year with such positive results and two years into our Medium-Term Strategy, we remain on track to achieve our four-year plan’s stated targets.”</p>

<p><strong>Ed continues:</strong> “I believe that our success over the past 12 months is thanks to our flexible service, people-led approach, and the hard work of our dedicated teams across the business. By continuing to focus on increasing own book lending, growing the respective teams across the business, and building on the relationships we hold across the sector, we’ve been able to demonstrate our extensive expertise.</p>

<p>“Building upon our relationships with brokers, stakeholders and partners is also vital for us to be able to deliver the very best service for our SMEs. That’s why our strategy this year has included investing in our partnerships, systems, and processes, and we look forward to seeing the positive impact this will make on the performance of our business.”</p>

<p>Time Finance will publish its audited Annual Results and Financial Statements on 26 September 2023.</p>]]></content>

		<updated><![CDATA[2023-07-17 14:10:20]]></updated>
		<content><![CDATA[<p>Nearly a year into her career with Time Finance, we caught up with Amy Holland, Legal Administrator, to hear all about her journey with the business so far and why she was selected as one of our Rising Stars for this year.</p>

<p><strong>How long have you been with Time Finance and could you describe your current role?</strong></p>

<p>When I joined Time Finance I’d just completed my criminology degree when I was offered a position in customer services. My manager, Alex Dowson, quickly saw that my interests lay with legal and encouraged me to transition to that side of the business. I’m so thankful that he helped this to happen because I love my role as Legal Administrator.</p>

<p>There’s a lot of close communications and problem solving involved with my work; I liaise closely with a number of different areas within the business to help reach resolutions in credit control, and I also work directly with businesses to help them with repayments.</p>

<p><strong>How did you get into the industry?</strong></p>

<p>I really enjoyed my criminology degree but I knew that my interests lay with international law, which I’m now getting formal training on with Time Finance. I’m due to start studying for a CILEX law qualification, which is essentially a law degree that I can study for alongside my role here.</p>

<p>I get opportunities to learn from my manager every day; I had no idea about lots of the specifics around the lending market beforehand, so it’s been great to have the opportunity to learn new things. There are occasions where we work with external solicitors, which has been fascinating and it’s given me such invaluable experience.</p>

<p><strong>Why do you think you were selected for Time Finance’s Rising Star Award?</strong></p>

<p>I was really proud to have been selected; I’d only been in the job for eight months so to see that my hard work has been noticed, I was so happy. Since being in my new role, I like to think I’ve made an impact and we’ve been able to take the legal team from strength to strength and get some really great results.</p>

<p><strong>What would you say the best part about your role is?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>It’s been quite a challenge taking on a new position but there are so many things I love about it. My passions lie with legal and it’s a very important part of the business. It makes me proud to know that I’ve been trusted to deal with such a big area of the company’s finances.</p>

<p>The best part of my role is definitely helping people. It can be quite heavy sometimes, but being able to help struggling businesses can be rewarding. We have the know-how to actually help people and set up plans, which means these businesses and the people within them can overcome any issues in balancing their finances.</p>

<p><strong>What do you think it takes to be successful in your role? Are there certain skills in the industry that are valued?</strong></p>

<p>You definitely need a sense of compassion and understanding. There are lots of cases that we can work with to reach positive outcomes. But there’s a fine balancing act involved and there are equally lots of cases where we need to assert ourselves so striking the right balance is always the key to succeeding.</p>

<p><strong>What advice would you give to anybody looking to get noticed in the workplace?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>My advice would be to just throw your hat in the ring. Take yourself out of your comfort zone. If you’d have told me a year ago that I’d be a Legal Admin in a company that I love, I wouldn’t have believed you. You just have to go for it and if it doesn’t work out it wasn’t made for you!</p>

<p><strong>What are your future career aspirations? In what ways do you see your current position at Time Finance helping you get there?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>I love working in legal at Time Finance; it’s such a supportive company and my current role is offering me invaluable experience. I’m really keen to carry on working the way I am and keep picking up those challenges, risks and opportunities to grow.</p>]]></content>

<p dir="ltr">Depending on which type is chosen, your clients have the option to gain full ownership of the asset, return it to us, or upgrade it for a newer model at the end of the asset finance agreement.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Both Finance Lease and Hire Purchase agreements can cover a range of different business equipment, including both hard assets (manufacturing equipment, industrial vehicles, construction equipment, etc.) and soft assets (office furniture, IT software, shop fit-outs, etc.). However, there are a few key differences between how the lease and its terms are structured:</p>

<p dir="ltr">
	<br>
</p>

<h4 dir="ltr">Finance Lease</h4>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">When you choose a<a href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/finance-lease">&nbsp;Finance Lease</a>, instead of paying for an asset upfront, your client will agree to rent the asset for a fixed or minimum term and make regular payments over an agreed period of time.</p>

<p dir="ltr">At the end of the lease period, your client must return the asset to us or take out a new lease. <strong>There is no option for your client to purchase the asset from us at the end of the lease period</strong> with this type of Asset Financing.</p>

<p dir="ltr">This form of Asset Finance is therefore most appropriate for leasing specialist equipment or machinery that the business might only need on a short-term basis.</p>

<p dir="ltr">
	<br>
</p>

<h4 dir="ltr">Hire Purchase</h4>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">With a<a href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/hire-purchase">&nbsp;Hire Purchase agreement</a>, your client will acquire an asset from us over a specified period of time. <strong>At the end of the contract, your client will then own the asset.</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">Typically, your client will have to pay an initial lump sum at the start of the term, fixed payments over the course of the finance agreement, and a final payment at the end of the term to secure the final purchase.</p>

		<content><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Invoice Finance enables SMEs to access the value of outstanding customer invoices before they are due, which relieves some of the pressure from mounting overheads by keeping the flow of cash moving continuously.</p>

<p dir="ltr">According to recent data,<a href="https://timefinance.com/press-releases/late-payments-cause-7-in-10-businesses-to-worry-about-cashflow">&nbsp;75% of UK businesses worry about cash flow as a direct result of overdue invoices from their customers</a>, and 100% of SMEs now claim that more of their customers are paying late due to increased overheads across the board.</p>

<p dir="ltr">If your business is one of those affected by the late payments cycle,<a href="https://timefinance.com/about-us">&nbsp;Time Finance can help</a>. With our<a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance">&nbsp;Invoice Financing solutions</a>, SMEs can get paid faster for finished work and are no longer held back by slow or late customer payments, alleviating some of the<a href="https://timefinance.com/time-blog/the-importance-of-cashflow">&nbsp;issues that arise from poor cash flow</a>.</p>

<p dir="ltr">In this guide, we'll cover everything you need to know about Invoice Finance for SMEs, including</p>

<ul>
	<li aria-level="1" dir="ltr">

		<p dir="ltr">The effects of poor cash flow on small businesses</p>
	</li>
	<li aria-level="1" dir="ltr">

	</li>
</ul>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>To find out more about our range of Invoice Financing options and how they could benefit your business,<a href="https://timefinance.com/contact">&nbsp;get in touch with our dedicated team today</a>.</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">
	<br>
</p>

<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Poor cash flow: How does it happen and what are the effects?</strong></h2>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">One of the major reasons that small businesses have cash flow issues is because of late payments from customers.<a href="https://timefinance.com/time-blog/late-invoice-payments-what-to-do">&nbsp;Unpaid invoices have long posed a serious problem for businesses</a>, but poor cash flow has significantly worsened in recent years due to rising business costs.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The vicious late payment cycle has a domino effect that can prevent businesses from paying their bills, suppliers, and even their own employees in worst-case scenarios.</p>

<p dir="ltr">And as the domino effect continues down the chain, more and more businesses are impacted.<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/31/business-insolvencies-firms-go-bust-2022-england-wales">&nbsp;Around 22,000 viable businesses were forced to fold in 2022 alone</a> as a result of poor cash flow caused by unpaid invoices.</p>

<p dir="ltr">
	<br>
</p>

<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>How can Invoice Financing help SMEs improve cash flow?</strong></h2>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/invoice-finance">Invoice Finance is a simple but effective solution to get cash running into your business</a> without having to rely on customer invoices being paid on time. It removes the long wait time that is the cause of so many cash flow issues and is also an excellent way to fund the early stages of business growth.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Sometimes also known as Invoice Factoring or Invoice Discounting, the way this funding solution works is quite straightforward.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Instead of waiting 30, 60, or even 90 days for customers to pay their invoices, Invoice Finance bridges the gap by allowing businesses to access the value of their unpaid invoices within 24 hours of the invoice being raised.</p>

<p dir="ltr">This immediate access to cash gives SMEs the financial freedom to ensure suppliers, HMRC, and employees are paid on time. The additional working capital also gives firms more headroom for growth and allows them to invest in new equipment, machinery, and personnel.</p>

<p dir="ltr">At Time Finance,<a href="https://timefinance.com/">&nbsp;we help firms access up to 90% of the value of their unpaid invoices in just 24 hours, minus our agreed service fee</a>.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Because we know that every situation is unique, we tailor our solutions to each business that we work with and regularly review the level of funding to make sure it’s right for them. So, as their business grows, so does the level of funding available.</p>

<p dir="ltr">
	<br>
</p>

<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Types of Invoice Finance for SMEs</strong></h2>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">The terms "Invoice Discounting" and "Invoice Factoring" are often used interchangeably with "Invoice Financing", but it's important to remember that they don't quite mean the same thing.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Invoice Factoring and Invoice Discounting are actually two different types of Invoice Financing that work in slightly different ways:</p>

<p dir="ltr">
	<br>
</p>

<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Invoice Factoring</strong></h3>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">Time Finance's<a href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/invoice-factoring">&nbsp;Invoice Factoring services</a> allow businesses to gain up to 90% of the value of their unpaid invoices within just 24 hours.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Essentially, Invoice Factoring (sometimes known as<a href="https://timefinance.com/time-blog/receivables-factoring-explained">&nbsp;Receivables Factoring</a>) involves a business outsourcing its invoices to the Invoice Finance company they are borrowing from. With this type of Invoice Finance, you would issue invoices to your clients as usual, but then Time Finance would take responsibility for chasing the outstanding invoices.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Invoice Factoring agreements are an excellent option for SMEs because they remove the often costly necessity of employing your own credit control department.</p>

<p dir="ltr">At Time Finance, businesses receive a dedicated and experienced credit controller who will make regular contact with customers on their behalf. This gives companies some much-needed freedom and flexibility without impacting client retention and loyalty.</p>

<p dir="ltr">
	<br>
</p>

<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Invoice Discounting</strong></h3>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/invoice-discounting">Invoice Discounting</a> gives businesses the benefit of getting an injection of cash, without notifying their customers that an Invoice Finance facility is involved.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The way it works is almost identical to Invoice Factoring services, but instead of having one of our credit controllers contact your customers, all communications and financial procedures are dealt with by you.</p>

<p dir="ltr">If your business already has the facilities to operate its own credit control services, then this might be the best form of Invoice Finance for you.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>If you're interested in exploring Invoice Finance but are unsure which type would work best for your business,<a href="https://timefinance.com/contact">&nbsp;get in touch with our expert team for advice</a>.</strong></p>

		<updated><![CDATA[2023-07-21 09:50:57]]></updated>
		<content><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">You’ll already know it as<a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/asset-finance">&nbsp;one of the most helpful forms of business funding around</a>, but if your clients are asking “what is asset finance?” - the Time Finance team can help make things simple.</p>

<p dir="ltr">As a broker, you might have already structured an asset finance solution to help a business raise valuable working capital.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">It can then be used to buy vital equipment for operations, which is great news for entrepreneurs hoping to pursue exciting investment plans or simply preserve internal cash flow.</p>

<p dir="ltr">As such, asset financing can make it easier for SMEs to fund future projects, access the latest equipment, introduce new technologies and even enhance and accelerate operations.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>That’s why hundreds of brokers turn to us when it comes to finding the best asset financing solutions for their clients.</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">With a range of options to suit each business' requirement, whether that's to own the equipment outright or upgrade it for a newer specification at the end of the term, our asset finance solution has helped brokers and their clients<a href="https://timefinance.com/clients">&nbsp;thrive across an impressive range of industries.</a></p>

<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;In this guide, our experts will give you and your clients the full breakdown on:&nbsp;</p>

	</li>
</ul>

<p dir="ltr">So let’s get started!&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">
	<br>
</p>

<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>What is asset finance?</strong></h2>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">If you’re looking to propose asset finance to your clients, it’s good to get a working definition.</p>

<p dir="ltr">At Time Finance, asset financing is often used to help SMEs acquire new equipment, technology, furniture, and software at affordable rates.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">However, finance options like this can be used for all kinds of assets that businesses might need, whether the investment is in brand-new equipment or is a second-hand acquisition.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>So what is asset finance’s main draw?</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">If your client is keen to upscale without sacrificing lots of capital at once, an asset finance solution can work wonders.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">That’s because it allows them to spread the cost of investing over a longer period of time, without having to pay out a lump sum in order to invest in their new piece of equipment.</p>

<p dir="ltr">That means your clients can secure the latest technology and leading equipment without worrying about staunching savings - which can be an inefficient form of financing and strain internal cash flow.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">However, asset finance can be further customised to suit your client’s needs, with a number of finance options available, including 'Hire Purchase' and 'Finance Lease'.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">In these cases, businesses have the choice of taking full ownership of the asset, returning it to us, or upgrading it when the agreement ends.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">
	<br>
</p>

<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Which businesses can benefit from this solution</strong></h3>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">At Time Finance, we support all kinds of SMEs from a number of sectors and backgrounds.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">So if you have clients who are looking to secure new assets within their businesses or further their growth plans, we’d be more than happy to help.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Using asset finance to help your client’s growth</strong></h3>

<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p dir="ltr">However, there are a few differences between how the lease and its terms are structured:</p>

<p dir="ltr">
	<br>
</p>

<h4 dir="ltr"><strong>Hire Purchase</strong></h4>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/hire-purchase">Hire-Purchase is a structured solution that allows a business to acquire an asset from the lender like Time Finance - and pay for it - over a specified period of time</a>. Once it has been paid off, your client can then own the item at the end of the contract.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/finance-lease">Similarly to a Finance Lease agreement</a>, Hire Purchase agreements give businesses helpful access to crucial pieces of equipment and machinery, without having to stump up a lump sum that could cost their cash flow.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Hire purchase contracts often require a lump sum right at the start of the term. Then there are easy-to-budget fixed payments over the course of the agreement before a final payment at the end of the term to secure the overall purchase.</p>

<p dir="ltr">
	<br>
</p>

<h4 dir="ltr"><strong>Finance Lease</strong></h4>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">On the other hand, a Finance Lease works on a ‘rental model.’&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">So instead of paying the money for an asset upfront, your client will agree to&nbsp;<a href="https://timefinance.com/finance-products/equipment-leasing">loan the asset for a fixed or minimum term and make payments over an agreed period</a> of time. Throughout the lease agreement, your client is responsible for paying monthly rental payments - but will have full use of the asset.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Then, at the end of the lease period, the asset is returned and a new lease can be taken out.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">However, there is no option to own or purchase the asset at the end of the lease period and it must be returned.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">
	<br>
</p>

<h4 dir="ltr">How does this help SMEs?</h4>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">In contrast to traditional loans, asset finance may make it simpler to raise money for their additional financial needs.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">As well as acquiring vital equipment, using this financial solution to bridge the cost of an asset can help SMEs keep cash flow healthy - which is key to any growing business.</p>

<p dir="ltr">
	<br>
</p>

<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>What are the overall business advantages of asset finance?</strong></h3>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">You know that for your clients, getting faster access to the equipment they need to run and grow their business, can make big things happen.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Let's explore some of the key benefits you can share with your clients to help them to understand just <a href="https://timefinance.com/financial-solutions/asset-finance">how asset finance can help their business thrive.</a></p>

<p dir="ltr">
	<br>
</p>

<h4 dir="ltr">More affordable</h4>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">As well as maintaining cash flow, it can make equipment financing more affordable overall, thanks to spreadable costs set over a predetermined period.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">
	<br>
</p>

<h4 dir="ltr">Easy-to-budget</h4>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">This makes it easy to budget while enjoying the use of their brand-new asset, whether your client chooses to keep it or not.</p>

<p dir="ltr">
	<br>
</p>

<h4 dir="ltr">Flexible options</h4>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">With flexible repayment options, asset finance can also support businesses looking to refinance existing assets to support cash flow.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">
	<br>
</p>

<h4 dir="ltr">Tax benefits</h4>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">Businesses can not only gain a competitive edge by accessing the latest equipment and technological innovations, but also access potential tax benefits.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>It’s important to note that tax reliefs may not be available to every business. The availability and value of any tax reliefs depend on the individual circumstances of your client and their business.</strong></p>

		<slug><![CDATA[insolvencies-are-down-but-time-finance-urges-businesses-to-stay-alert]]></slug>
		<published><![CDATA[2023-08-01 08:42:13]]></published>
		<updated><![CDATA[2023-08-01 08:42:13]]></updated>
		<content><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/businessdemographyquarterlyexperimentalstatisticsukapriltojune2023">Recent figures</a> from the ONS have revealed a 15% drop in insolvencies in the last 12 months, with reports falling from 99,300 to 84,080. Whilst these stats reflect positivity, the report also points to an ongoing decline of business startups, with Q2 of 2023 being the eighth consecutive quarter where business births have been lower than business deaths.<em>&nbsp;</em>Chief Executive at Time Finance, Ed Rimmer reflects on the real impact of these statistics…</p>

<p>“The fall in numbers of businesses folding this year suggests the economy is in much better shape than we might have first thought. Only six months ago we were seeing some of the <a href="https://timefinance.com/time-blog/the-road-to-recovery-keeping-viable-businesses-from-going-under">highest insolvency rates</a> on record, so it’s clear to see that businesses are prevailing against the many challenges sent their way and there is certainly cause for optimism as we head further into Q3.</p>

<p>“The alternative finance industry has played a huge role in supporting small businesses and avoiding liquidation figures rising for viable businesses. Whilst insolvencies are falling, it's now vital that we don’t take our foot off the gas. The next six months will continue to present challenges - rising interest rates and inflation - so it's important that business confidence does not waver.</p>

<p>“The alternative industry needs to continue to do what it does best - coming together to provide a flexible and people-led approach to specialist financing. Our job is to help businesses realise their ambitions; for some this is innovation and growth, but for many others it is simply to continue trading until they are able to once again think more long-term - but all the while keeping insolvency at bay.</p>

<p>“We often look to the number of startups as an indicator of a healthy economy, but with business creations down 14% to 77,095 last quarter in comparison with the year prior, it’s clear there is still some work to be done to stabilise the economy and put fire in the belly of potential new entrepreneurs to take on their next venture. What these startups need right now is a more long-term plan to help stabilise the economy and create better growth conditions for new business.”</p>]]></content>
